## FAQ

1. **When next/orbital flight?** Unknown. Launches on hold until FAA environmental review completed and ground equipment ready. Gwyn Shotwell has indicated [June or July](https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/shotwell-starship). Completing GSE, booster, and ship testing, and Raptor 2 production refinements, mean 2H 2022 at earliest - pessimistically, possibly even early 2023 if FAA requires significant mitigations.
1. **Expected date for FAA decision?** [May 31 per latest FAA statement](https://www.faa.gov/space/stakeholder_engagement/spacex_starship), updated on April 29.
1. **What booster/ship pair will fly first?** Likely either B7 or B8 with S24. B7 undergoing repairs after a testing issue; TBD if repairs will allow flight or only further ground testing.
1. **Will more suborbital testing take place?** Unknown. It may depend on the FAA decision.
1. **Has progress slowed down?** SpaceX focused on completing ground support equipment (GSE, or ""Stage 0"") before any orbital launch, which Elon stated is as complex as building the rocket. Florida Stage 0 construction has also ramped up.

We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

## FAQ

1. **When next/orbital flight?** Unknown. Launches on hold until FAA environmental review completed. Elon says orbital test [hopefully May](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1505987581464367104?cxt=HHwWgMCq1b3uq-YpAAAA). Others believe completing GSE, booster, and ship testing makes a late 2022 orbital launch possible but unlikely.
1. **Expected date for FAA decision?** [April 29 per FAA statement](https://twitter.com/jeff_foust/status/1507451621273440281), but it has been delayed many times.
1. **Will Booster 4 / Ship 20 fly?** No. Elon [confirmed](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1505987581464367104?cxt=HHwWgMCq1b3uq-YpAAAA) first orbital flight will be with Raptor 2 (B7/S24).
1. **Will more suborbital testing take place?** Unknown. It may depend on the FAA decision.
1. **Has progress slowed down?** SpaceX focused on completing ground support equipment (GSE, or ""Stage 0"") before any orbital launch, which Elon stated is as complex as building the rocket.

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

### Starlink Versions

#### Starlink V0.9
The first batch of starlink sats launched in the new starlink formfactor. Each sat had a launch mass of 227kg. They have only a Ku-band antenna installed on the sat. Many of them are now being actively deorbited

#### Starlink V1.0
The upgraded productional batch of starlink sats ,everyone launched since Nov 2019 belongs to this version. Upgrades include a Ka-band antenna. The launch mass increased to ~260kg.

#### Starlink DarkSat
Darksat is a prototype with a darker coating on the bottom to reduce reflectivity, launched on Starlink V1.0-L2.
Due to reflection in the IR spectrum and stronger heating, this approach was no longer pursued

#### Starlink VisorSat
VisorSat is SpaceX's currently approach to solve the reflection issue when the sats have reached their operational orbit. The first prototype was launched on Starlink V1.0-L7 in June 2020. Starlink V1.0-L9 will be the first launch with every sat being an upgraded VisorSat

#### Starlink V1.5
These satellites include laser links to other satellites.  Prototype lasers were launched to polar orbits on Transporter 1 &amp; 2 with production launches beginning with Starlink 2-1.

We will attempt to keep the above text regularly updated with resources and new mission information, but for the most part, updates will appear in the comments first. Feel free to ping us if additions or corrections are needed.  Approximately 24 hours before liftoff of a Starlink,  a launch thread will go live and the party will begin there.

**This is not a party-thread Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

[r/SpaceX Discuss Thread](/r/spacex/comments/shgfej/rspacex_thread_index_and_general_discussion/) for discussion of subjects other than Starship development.

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

This will now be used as a campaign thread for Starlink launches. You can find the most important details about a upcoming launch in the section below.

This thread can be also used for other small Starlink-related matters; for example, a new ground station, photos, questions, routine FCC applications, and the like.



## Upcoming Launches

The launches for the first shell are now completed. 
We expect future Starlink launches from both the West coast (Vandenberg SLC-4E) and the East coast (SLC-40 and LC-39A).  West coast launches are thought to be for the 70° shell and East coast launches for the 53.2° shell, based on FCC filings.

The next Starlink launch is [Starlink Group 4-5 from KSC LC-39A on 2022-01-18 at 00:26:00 UTC](https://twitter.com/TSKelso/status/1482165633802334208).

### Starlink Versions

#### Starlink V0.9
The first batch of starlink sats launched in the new starlink formfactor. Each sat had a launch mass of 227kg. They have only a Ku-band antenna installed on the sat. Many of them are now being actively deorbited

#### Starlink V1.0
The upgraded productional batch of starlink sats ,everyone launched since Nov 2019 belongs to this version. Upgrades include a Ka-band antenna. The launch mass increased to ~260kg.

#### Starlink DarkSat
Darksat is a prototype with a darker coating on the bottom to reduce reflectivity, launched on Starlink V1.0-L2.
Due to reflection in the IR spectrum and stronger heating, this approach was no longer pursued

#### Starlink VisorSat
VisorSat is SpaceX's currently approach to solve the reflection issue when the sats have reached their operational orbit. The first prototype was launched on Starlink V1.0-L7 in June 2020. Starlink V1.0-L9 will be the first launch with every sat being an upgraded VisorSat

#### Starlink V1.5
These satellites include laser links to other satellites.  Prototype lasers were launched to polar orbits on Transporter 1 &amp; 2 with production launches beginning with Starlink 2-1.

### About The Recovery

Ground controllers at SpaceX in Hawthorne, California, will send commands at 10:40 a.m. for Dragon to undock from the space-facing port of the station’s Harmony module and fire its thrusters to move a safe distance away from the station. Controllers will command a deorbit burn the following day.

After re-entering Earth’s atmosphere, the spacecraft will make a parachute-assisted splashdown about 12:44 a.m. Monday, Jan. 24, off the coast of Florida. NASA TV will not broadcast the splashdown but the agency will provide updates on the space station blog.

### Returning Science

*  Last light: A state-of-the-art light imaging microscope, the Light Microscopy Module (LMM) will return after about 12 years on the station. LMM, sponsored by NASA’s Division of Biological and Physical Sciences, made it possible to observe and record the way matter is organized and moves on the microscopic level, and supported ground-breaking colloid research, plant studies, and thermophysics experiments.

* Tiny structures, assemble: The InSPACE-4 physics study is returning samples that could provide insight into how to harness nanoparticles to fabricate and manufacture new materials, including medical diagnostics and thermal shields for Earth and space applications.

* Cell signaling in microgravity: The ESA (European Space Agency) investigation Cytoskeleton contributes to understanding of how the human body responds to microgravity. The study could support development of countermeasures to help astronaut crew members maintain optimum health on future space missions.

[r/SpaceX Discuss Thread](/r/spacex/comments/rt6p4j/rspacex_thread_index_and_general_discussion/) for discussion of subjects other than Starship development.

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

This will now be used as a campaign thread for Starlink launches. You can find the most important details about a upcoming launch in the section below.

This thread can be also used for other small Starlink-related matters; for example, a new ground station, photos, questions, routine FCC applications, and the like.



## Upcoming Launches

The launches for the first shell are now completed. 
We expect future Starlink launches from both the West coast (Vandenberg SLC-4E) and the East coast (SLC-40 and LC-39A).  West coast launches are thought to be for the 70° shell and East coast launches for the 53.2° shell, based on FCC filings.

The next Starlink launch is [Starlink 4-3](https://twitter.com/EmreKelly/status/1462977907626754050)

### Starlink Versions

#### Starlink V0.9
The first batch of starlink sats launched in the new starlink formfactor. Each sat had a launch mass of 227kg. They have only a Ku-band antenna installed on the sat. Many of them are now being actively deorbited

#### Starlink V1.0
The upgraded productional batch of starlink sats ,everyone launched since Nov 2019 belongs to this version. Upgrades include a Ka-band antenna. The launch mass increased to ~260kg.

#### Starlink DarkSat
Darksat is a prototype with a darker coating on the bottom to reduce reflectivity, launched on Starlink V1.0-L2.
Due to reflection in the IR spectrum and stronger heating, this approach was no longer pursued

#### Starlink VisorSat
VisorSat is SpaceX's currently approach to solve the reflection issue when the sats have reached their operational orbit. The first prototype was launched on Starlink V1.0-L7 in June 2020. Starlink V1.0-L9 will be the first launch with every sat being an upgraded VisorSat

#### Starlink V1.5
These satellites include laser links to other satellites.  Prototype lasers were launched to polar orbits on Transporter 1 &amp; 2 with production launches beginning with Starlink 2-1.

[r/SpaceX Discuss Thread](/r/spacex/comments/qk1xi9/rspacex_thread_index_and_general_discussion/) for discussion of subjects other than Starship development.

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

This will now be used as a campaign thread for Starlink launches. You can find the most important details about a upcoming launch in the section below.

This thread can be also used for other small Starlink-related matters; for example, a new ground station, photos, questions, routine FCC applications, and the like.



## Upcoming Launches

The launches for the first shell are now completed.  We are currently in a hiatus between launches.

We expect future Starlink launches from both the West coast (Vandenberg SLC-4E) and the East coast (SLC-40 and LC-39A).  West coast launches are thought to be for the 70° shell and East coast launches for the 53.2° shell, based on FCC filings.

### Starlink Versions

#### Starlink V0.9
The first batch of starlink sats launched in the new starlink formfactor. Each sat had a launch mass of 227kg. They have only a Ku-band antenna installed on the sat. Many of them are now being actively deorbited

#### Starlink V1.0
The upgraded productional batch of starlink sats ,everyone launched since Nov 2019 belongs to this version. Upgrades include a Ka-band antenna. The launch mass increased to ~260kg.

#### Starlink DarkSat
Darksat is a prototype with a darker coating on the bottom to reduce reflectivity, launched on Starlink V1.0-L2.
Due to reflection in the IR spectrum and stronger heating, this approach was no longer pursued

#### Starlink VisorSat
VisorSat is SpaceX's currently approach to solve the reflection issue when the sats have reached their operational orbit. The first prototype was launched on Starlink V1.0-L7 in June 2020. Starlink V1.0-L9 will be the first launch with every sat being an upgraded VisorSat

#### Starlink V1.5
These satellites include laser links to other satellites.  Prototype lasers were launched to polar orbits on Transporter 1 &amp; 2 with production launches beginning with Starlink 2-1.

While I'm sure that Dr. Zubrin needs no introduction for most of us here, for those of you who are new, Dr. Zubrin is the Mars Society President and one of its original 1998 founders. One of Earth's most famous and passionate advocates for Mars, Dr. Zubrin backs that energy with serious engineering knowledge. He has contributed to hundreds of space exploration and nuclear tech research papers, including the famous Mars Direct mission which was a major influence on Elon’s own Martian ambitions! He has also authored or co-authored over a dozen books, not to mention literally hundreds of interviews on the subject, many of which are available on Youtube. Zubrin has spent his considerable talents towards figuring out exactly how to get to Mars for decades. Since SpaceX was founded with the primary goal of getting humanity to Mars, clearly there is a deep shared purpose here. Dr. Zubrin has been watching SpaceX from the start with as much interest as any of us!

The Mars Society also has their upcoming 23rd annual international convention on Oct 15-18, which is online this year and free to join.  
https://www.marssociety.org/conventions/2021/

We’re looking forward to another spectacular AMA, and we trust that this community will have some really solid questions for Dr. Z!

Special thanks to Edward Heisler and Lucinda Offer of The Mars Society (https://www.marssociety.org/) for helping put together this AMA. You can get involved without ever leaving reddit on r/MarsSociety, where you can really get involved in getting our asses to Mars!",1632277280

[r/SpaceX Discusses [August 2021]](/r/spacex/comments/ovhuzd/rspacex_thread_index_and_general_discussion/) for discussion of subjects other than Starship development.

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

[r/SpaceX Discusses [July 2021]](/r/spacex/comments/obh9lw/rspacex_thread_index_and_general_discussion_july/) for discussion of subjects other than Starship development.

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

### Starlink Versions

#### Starlink V0.9
The first batch of starlink sats launched in the new starlink formfactor. Each sat had a launch mass of 227kg. They have only a Ku-band antenna installed on the sat. Many of them are now being actively deorbited

#### Starlink V1.0
The upgraded productional batch of starlink sats ,everyone launched since Nov 2019 belongs to this version. Upgrades include a Ka-band antenna. The launch mass increased to ~260kg.

#### Starlink DarkSat
Darksat is a prototype with a darker coating on the bottom to reduce reflectivity, launched on Starlink V1.0-L2.
Due to reflection in the IR spectrum and stronger heating, this approach was no longer pursued
#### Starlink VisorSat
VisorSat is SpaceX's currently approach to solve the reflection issue when the sats have reached their operational orbit. The first prototype was launched on Starlink V1.0-L7 in June 2020. Starlink V1.0-L9 will be the first launch with every sat being an upgraded VisorSat

[r/SpaceX Discusses [July 2021]](/r/spacex/comments/obh9lw/rspacex_thread_index_and_general_discussion_july/) for discussion of subjects other than Starship development.

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

Falcon 9 launches to sun-synchronous polar orbit from Florida as part of SpaceX's Rideshare program dedicated to smallsat customers. The mission lifts off from SLC-40, Cape Canaveral on a southward azimuth and performs a dogleg maneuver. The booster for this mission is expected to return to LZ-1 based on FCC communications filings.

This rideshare takes approximately 90 satellites and hosted payloads into orbit on a variety of deployers including three free-flying spacecraft which dispense their customers' satellites after separation from the SpaceX stack.

We will attempt to keep the above text regularly updated with resources and new mission information, but for the most part, updates will appear in the comments first. Feel free to ping us if additions or corrections are needed. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather, and more as we progress towards launch. Approximately 24 hours before liftoff, the launch thread will go live and the party will begin there.

### Starlink Versions

#### Starlink V0.9
The first batch of starlink sats launched in the new starlink formfactor. Each sat had a launch mass of 227kg. They have only a Ku-band antenna installed on the sat. Many of them are now being actively deorbited

#### Starlink V1.0
The upgraded productional batch of starlink sats ,everyone launched since Nov 2019 belongs to this version. Upgrades include a Ka-band antenna. The launch mass increased to ~260kg.

#### Starlink DarkSat
Darksat is a prototype with a darker coating on the bottom to reduce reflectivity, launched on Starlink V1.0-L2.
Due to reflection in the IR spectrum and stronger heating, this approach was no longer pursued
#### Starlink VisorSat
VisorSat is SpaceX's currently approach to solve the reflection issue when the sats have reached their operational orbit. The first prototype was launched on Starlink V1.0-L7 in June. Starlink V1.0-L9 will be the first launch with every sat being an upgraded VisorSat

### Starlink Versions

#### Starlink V0.9
The first batch of starlink sats launched in the new starlink formfactor. Each sat had a launch mass of 227kg. They have only a Ku-band antenna installed on the sat. Many of them are now being actively deorbited

#### Starlink V1.0
The upgraded productional batch of starlink sats ,everyone launched since Nov 2019 belongs to this version. Upgrades include a Ka-band antenna. The launch mass increased to ~260kg.

#### Starlink DarkSat
Darksat is a prototype with a darker coating on the bottom to reduce reflectivity, launched on Starlink V1.0-L2.
Due to reflection in the IR spectrum and stronger heating, this approach was no longer pursued
#### Starlink VisorSat
VisorSat is SpaceX's currently approach to solve the reflection issue when the sats have reached their operational orbit. The first prototype was launched on Starlink V1.0-L7 in June. Starlink V1.0-L9 will be the first launch with every sat being an upgraded VisorSat

* Updating the software on our orbiting Starlink satellites (the largest constellation in space!)
* Designing software for the Starlink space lasers terminals for high-speed data transmission
* Developing software to support our first all civilian mission (Inspiration4)
* Completing our first operational Crew Dragon mission (Crew-1)
* Designing the onboard user interfaces for astronauts
* Rapid iteration of Starship’s flight software and user interface

**We are:**

* Jarrett Farnitano – I work on Dragon vehicle software including the crew displays
* Kristine Huang – I lead application software for Starlink constellation
* Jeanette Miranda – I develop firmware for lasercom
* Asher Dunn - I lead Starship software
* Natalie Morris - I lead software test infrastructure for satellites

### General Software Q&amp;A

Q: I write software for stuff that isn't life or death. Because of this, I feel comfortable guessing &amp; checking, copying &amp; pasting, not having full test coverage, etc. and consequently bugs get through every so often. How different is it to work on safety critical software?

A: Having worked on both safety critical and non-safety critical software, you absolutely need to have a different mentality. The most important thing is making sure you know how your software will behave in all different scenarios. This affects the entire development process including design, implementation and test. Design and implementation will tend towards smaller components with clear boundaries. This enables those components to be fully tested before they are integrated into a wider system. However, the full system still needs to be tested, which makes end to end testing and observability an important part of the process as well. By exposing information about the decisions the software is making in telemetry, we are able to automate monitoring of the software. This automation can be used in development, regression testing, as well against software running on the real vehicles during missions. This helps us to be confident the software is working as expected throughout its entire life cycle, especially when we have crew onboard. Jarrett

Q: What tools do you use for testing and continuous delivery? And how do you simulate rocket and satellite hardware?

A: A lot of this is custom. We have a whole team dedicated to building CI/CD tooling as well as the core infrastructure for testing and simulation that our vehicles use. The demands of running high-fidelity physics simulations alongside our software for the sake of testing it make for some interesting challenges that most off-the-shelf CI/CD tools don't handle super well. They not only require a lot of compute, but can also be long duration (think: flying Dragon from liftoff to Docking), and we need to be able to run both ""hardware out of the loop"" simulations as well as ""hardware in the loop"", where we load the software up on testbeds with copies of the actual computers and electronics. We've done a lot of work to make sure that developers can run those tests easily when doing their daily work - we can run the same kinds of tests on our workstations as in the CI cluster, and we can run cases on the hardware-in-the-loop testbeds before even merging changes. This lets us get a ton of confidence in the code we're writing. We do also leverage some things off-the-shelf; for example we use Bazel extensively for our build and unit testing needs.
-Natalie

Q: What challenges must be overcome to implement continuous integration and delivery for embedded, in-orbit systems like Starlink? Do you deploy your software in containers? What are the challenges in testing such an expansive network? Keep up the good work!

A: To manage a large satellite constellation without needing hundreds of human operators, we rely on software automation running on the ground and on the satellites. In order to fully test our systems in an end-to-end configuration, that means we have to integrate hundreds of different software services in a dev environment.  Another challenge in testing is that it's not always possible to test every single capability with one test. For example, we want automated tests that exercise the satellite-to-ground communication links. We have HITL (hardware in the loop) testbeds of the satellites, and we can set up a mock ground station with a fixed antenna. We can run a test where we simulate the satellite flying over the ground station, but we have to override the software so that it thinks it is always in contact with our fixed antenna. This lets us test the full RF and network stack, but doesn't let us test antenna pointing logic. Alternatively we can run pure software simulations to test antenna pointing. We have to make sure that we have sufficient piecemeal testing of all the important aspects of the system. - Natalie 

Q: How much love does Python get at SpaceX? It can obviously not be a first class passenger, but is it deployed anywhere significant?

A: We have a ton of Python at SpaceX! A lot of our ground-side tools have large Python aspects to them - systems like our data analysis services, testing infrastructure, and CI/CD system. It's not flying the vehicles, but it's super common for us to reach for Python to build a lot of other systems. One of the unique aspects of Python is that it's a great language for non-software engineers (mechanical, propulsion,...) to learn and work in. We've had a lot of success using it to write test cases for software and hardware, automated data analysis pipelines, and similar areas where engineers with a variety of backgrounds need to be able to contribute. - Kristine

Q: What is your tech stack? Languages, frameworks, libraries, etc... What tools/editors/IDEs do you use in your day to day work? How does QA validate developer's work since you can't exactly fly up there and test it out?

A: At SpaceX, we don't separate QA from development - every engineer writing software is also expected to contribute to its testing. We generally try to do as much testing pre-merge as possible on our high-fidelity hardware testbeds. Our test code and test results are peer-reviewed alongside the flight code to make sure that we are testing all the right things. We also do have independent engineers developing end-to-end tests that stress the whole system. One unique thing about testing for a large satellite constellation is that we can actually use ""canary"" satellites to test out new features. We run regression tests on the software to ensure it won't break critical functionality, but then we can select a satellite, deploy the new feature, and monitor how it behaves with minimal risk to the constellation. - Natalie

Q: I'd love some insights into how you transmit the data from the spacecraft to the ground. One data stream or many? What's the format look like? Human readable or raw bytes? How do you distinguish different pieces of data for different sub-systems/sensors? How do you parse it for analysis? Thanks!

A: Generally, there is lots of data coming in from many sources all the time. It's all in raw bytes in a proprietary format with enough context to know where each point came from and what measurement it represents. - Kristine

Q: Could you please expand on the 'rapid iteration of Starship's...user interface'?

A: We're using the same web-components based frontend architecture as Dragon Crew Displays, but we've made everything user-configurable. This allows engineers and operators to directly customize the views they need to do their job, and allows us as the software team to focus on making improvements to the UI core interface and platform. Working with a web-based system means that we can quickly prototype, test, and ship new UI capabilities. During development, we can point a locally-hosted instance of the UI to a running simulation or even real vehicle data, and take advantage of features such as hot-reloading to update the UI in real-time. The challenge is offering this level of flexibility while also evolving toward the polish, focus, and quality of the Dragon Crew Displays. This tends to be a full-stack challenge – many times, the interface is complicated and ugly when the system itself is hard to understand or use. As Starship matures, we're working closely with controllers and engineers to figure out where these pain points are, and how we can address them. Ultimately, we want Starship to be easy to control and understand during everyday flight operations. - Asher

Q: What tools do you use for testing and continuous delivery? And how do you simulate rocket and satellite hardware?

A: A lot of this is custom. We have a whole team dedicated to building CI/CD tooling as well as the core infrastructure for testing and simulation that our vehicles use. The demands of running high-fidelity physics simulations alongside our software for the sake of testing it make for some interesting challenges that most off-the-shelf CI/CD tools don't handle super well. They not only require a lot of compute, but can also be long duration (think: flying Dragon from liftoff to Docking), and we need to be able to run both ""hardware out of the loop"" simulations as well as ""hardware in the loop"", where we load the software up on testbeds with copies of the actual computers and electronics. We've done a lot of work to make sure that developers can run those tests easily when doing their daily work - we can run the same kinds of tests on our workstations as in the CI cluster, and we can run cases on the hardware-in-the-loop testbeds before even merging changes. This lets us get a ton of confidence in the code we're writing. We do also leverage some things off-the-shelf; for example we use Bazel extensively for our build and unit testing needs.- Natalie

Q: Which approach is better for a rocket's flight software – asynchronous or synchronous with many threads? When choosing tools, standards, do you tend to stick with conservative choices (C++ pre '11 rev) or are willing to try new things (newer C++17/20 standards, Rust)? How do you handle failures? How do you limit their impact?

A: The most important thing is to guarantee consistent performance. You can't fly a rocket if it's acting like a laggy video game! We use a mix of synchronous and asynchronous techniques, depending on the problem at hand. We aren't afraid to try new systems, strategies, standards, or languages, particularly early in the development of a new program. That said, mission success is paramount and we do need to keep our eye on future code maintainability, so we stay a little ways back from the bleeding edge compared to the average startup. - Asher

Q: Do you have hardware devs on your team? How do you make sure your software works with the current hardware (as both must be evolving rather quickly)?

A: The space lasers software team is a mix of firmware engineers and simulation software engineers, but we all regularly work alongside all different types of engineers at SpaceX. 
Like you imagined, both software and hardware are evolving rapidly and so we've invested in ways to automate testing at the intersection of these two. SpaceX has hardware-in-the-loop testbeds as part of our continuous integration system. Any new code changes will be run through a suite of regression testcases on one of these testbeds to ensure that software changes are compatible with the hardware. And vice-versa, any new hardware will also get included on these testbeds for verifying regression with the existing software. - Jeanette

Q: How does SpaceX get away with using Linux instead of a true real-time operating system on its vehicles? I know the PREEMPT_RT patch makes Linux more real-time, but still doesn't make it fully real-time. It seems like flying crewed rockets and spacecraft is a place where hard real-time guarantees would be necessary all of the time.

A: While I can't go into specifics here, we design our software to work without a fully real time OS. We also use a custom build of Linux and fully understand the environment in which our software and OS operates in. Operating in a much more constrained environment (as compared to say the open internet) combined with extensive instrumentation and hardware in the loop testing means we can know that the OS is going to behave as we expect it to when on orbit. -Jarrett

Q: I am a high schooler in a robotics team and we have many challenges with development. How does SpaceX filter data from various sensors? How does SpaceX integrate rapidly developing hardware with software? I am curious about the marriage between them since they are so dependent on one another.

A: It depends a lot on the sensor and what information you're trying to get from the sensor. We implement lots of filters on our vehicle, both analog and digital, in order to make sure the data we're using in control is real. Lots of communication. Software and hardware engineers at SpaceX work together to produce a working design. Take for instance a new hardware box that needs custom firmware. The firmware and hardware engineers will work together during the hardware design phase to ensure the system will work. Once the first prototypes arrive, the firmware engineer will get one of the first copies of hardware so they can work on the software. - Asher

Q: Do you implement control algorithms to embedded systems?

A: We're always trading the right place to run a control process. Sometimes the best place to put a control algorithm is an embedded system close to the thing being controlled. Other times, a process needs to be a lot more centralized. When you think about a vehicle as complex as Starship, there's not just a single control process, as you have to control engines, flaps, radio systems, etc. - Asher

Q: I read that one of the biggest challenges in writing flight software is that the software needs to be written in a way that failures and exceptions do not stop execution. What are the biggest types of challenges in writing software this way?

A: It is important in safety critical software that if a single software component were to have a problem, it does not impact the entire software system. Software also often depends on the hardware it is interacting with, so must account for hardware failures as well. Crashing and restarting just isn't an option. We approach this by building the software in modular components, writing defensive logic, and checking the status of each operation. If an operation we expect to complete fails, we have defined error handling paths and recovery strategies. Sometimes that strategy just means skipping over the operation. Sometimes the strategies can be more complex and involve responses such as switching to backup systems. - Jarrett

Q: What’s your CI/CD pipeline look like? Do new builds actually get installed on a “production” or “production-like” board hooked up to an automated test rack which provides simulated inputs to the sensors, or do all the automated tests run in an entirely simulated environment?

A: We have a lot of different types of test environments. Some are purely simulated environments, what we call HOOTLs (or Hardware Out Of The Loop). These can run in CI/CD but also on a developer's desktop for local iteration. Others involve flight-like hardware, what we call HITLs (Hardware In The Loop). Our Starlink HITL setups are just satellites we take off the production line and integrate with our CI systems. We set up our CI pipelines to start with fast, inexpensive tests to smoke out basic errors. Then if those pass, we run longer, more complicated tests. We also have different pipelines for different parts of the system. For example on Starlink, we'll have a pipeline for testing user terminal software in isolation. Once those tests pass, it will be incorporated into other pipelines that test the interface between the user terminal software and the satellites. -Natalie

Q: Your description says that you ""lead ..."". What does it mean to you to ""lead"" - when it comes to how your work is different, but also about what values and soft skills (if any) are important to you in your leadership?

A: The values and soft skills that are important to me in leadership are trust, humility, empathy, and resilience. Ensuring that each member of the team feels empowered to solve complex problems, celebrating the wins, and owning up to mistakes. Guiding the team with the product and technical vision. Reflecting on what we could have done better on a regular cadence so we can provide feedback and continuously grow as a team. - Kristine

Q: What is Software Engineering at SpaceX like?

A: Kristine:  We very strongly encourage our engineers to identify problems to solve and to own solutions to those problems end to end. This means thinking through each option as an architect, designer, developer, tester, and user which we think tends to lead to more elegant and better fitting solutions. Engineers are rewarded for increasing their scope, impact, and autonomy over time. Natalie:  Engineers at SpaceX tend to be passionate about our mission and invested in solving problems. We are not working long, hard hours all the time. There are occasionally times when we do, usually because we are fired up about a problem, motivated to collaborate with our teammates, and don't like to give up. In almost ten years here, I have never been bored 

Q: What’s the range of software positions at SpaceX?

A: It's easy to think of the software that runs on our vehicles when thinking of software engineering at SpaceX, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Some of our engineers are C++ developers writing code for flying Starship, but we also have engineers that are building core software test infrastructure, in-house web applications for the factory, constellation, and customers, automating production testing or writing the code to help orchestrate the network for Starlink. Our software engineers work in C++, Python, C#.NET, Java, Javascript, Angular, and more.
Check out the range of software positions we're hiring for at SpaceX. - Kristine and Jeanette

### Starship Q&amp;A

Q: What's the logic process that starship uses to determine engine validity for the flip and burn maneuver?

A: As you can tell by watching the videos of SN8 through SN15, this is an area we iterated on a lot! Fundamentally, Starship is designed to choose in real time the engine(s) best suited to execute the flip and landing burn. We updated the software to be smarter at detecting potential engine problems, and adjusted which problems could be compensated for in software (still OK to use that engine) vs which could not be (RUD!), on every flight. Asher

Q: Are you planning on using similar technology in the Starship environment, from crew displays to possible E2E software? Could you expand more on your usage of web components? How many application software engineers do you have currently, and are you looking for many more? Do you guys have a separate team for Starlink's web development? Do you keep your UI lightweight, or is that not a worry?

A: There are a lot of web-based interfaces at SpaceX–everything from the Crew Displays themselves, to the factory logistics tooling, to the lunch menus . For a given Starship operation, tasks like viewing procedures, controlling the vehicle, and viewing and analyzing data are all done via webapps. We're using web-component based frameworks for Crew Displays as well as Starship. Beyond the standard advantages (compartmentalization, interop, performance, etc), we particularly value the fact they they are native to the web platform. We treat our control interfaces with the same level of scrutiny as the rest of the flight software–meaning we need to audit any piece of third-party code we use, and keep track of any bugs that are publicly reported. The fact that these frameworks are relatively lightweight layers on top of native browser capabilities and can be used without bundling or compilation makes it much easier for us to be confident in them. While we have a sizable team, we are certainly looking for many more great application software engineers. Come join our team – no aerospace experience necessary (really!). Different teams within application software focus on different aspects of the various programs we have going on at any given time. For our control interfaces, we pay close attention to performance, but tend to focus on different metrics than standard webapps–our performance characteristics tend to be closer to that of a game (where you value realtime responsiveness, and the performance of V8 over time) than that of a more traditional website (which place a stronger emphasis on Web Vitals such as first load performance). Kristine

Q: How late do you make changes to the software on Starship test flights? We've seen a lot of things change, sometimes at the last minute, is the software one of them? Have you had to change the flip/landing strategy between the first upload and final flight software? Or is it more subtle and these things stay as planned ?

A: Since Starship is in development/testing we're set up to make software changes much later in the game than our other programs. There are many different types of software changes – large new features or refactors all the way down to changing a single number. The key question for each change is, how do we know this change is correct? What tests do we need to run before we fly? If we can be confident that making a last-minute change increases the likelihood of test success, we don't shy away (although of course we prefer having everything ready ahead of time whenever possible). - Asher

Q: How will the starship user interface be, will it be based on Crew dragon? Or will it be a new design? If thats the case, will it be bigger? and what features will need the biggest change?
Im sorry if the English isnt great!

A: The technology will likely be similar to Dragon, but the design, usage, and goals of the onboard Starship UI are notably different from Dragon. The Dragon Crew Displays are three touchscreens in a small vehicle with a singular destination, supporting a small group of passengers and their cargo. Starship will fly missions to locations worldwide, the Moon, Mars, and beyond. The Starship UI must be usable on devices and touchscreens of all sizes around the vehicle (common areas, living quarters, loading areas, and the bridge) and must support users with completely different jobs and skillsets. Long story short, it is a much more complex problem than Dragon! - Asher

Q: What is mainly changing between starship tests that leads to potential improvements? While I'm sure there are some physical design changes (or not?), is it mainly software updates in the onboard computer to improve calculations?

A: With a development program such as Starship, we're constantly learning from all aspects of the process. We continuously update the hardware and software on every vehicle to incorporate our latest ideas on what's going to get the best result for the upcoming test or mission. - Asher

Q: Considering how agile and rapidly iterative the hardware portion of the [Starship] program is, what kinds of challenges and opportunities does that present on the software side?

A: As a software team, the challenge is continuously improving while the hardware changes underneath us. Since we're always working closely with the hardware teams to improve the vehicle overall, we have the opportunity to drive hardware changes that make the software simpler or more robust. As hardware and software work together, we can try new ideas, and if the idea doesn't work out, we know we can try again. - Asher

Q: How much of the Software between Falcon 9 first stage and the Superheavy first stage can be reused vs has to be rewritten? What are some new things you expect to learn and will have to figure out with SuperHeavy vs what you already know and can apply from Falcon 9.

A: Starship reuses many ideas and some code from Falcon. We always want to spend our energy solving new problems that get us closer to Mars. Whenever a new problem comes up, we think back over our codebase and ask, what tools do we already have that will enable us to solve this as quickly as possible? - Asher

### Dragon Q&amp;A

Q: I see crew on Dragons using iPads and the touchscreens. What's the backup if those displays fail? Are those displays ""space hardened"", or do normal displays survive being exposed to the radiation in space while docked to the ISS?

A: Dragon is a fully autonomous vehicle, so it is capable of completing the trip to and from the ISS without any interaction from the crew. But the displays and button panel do provide the crew with capabilities should they need to take action due an unexpected scenario or emergency. As for the tablets and displays, the tablets themselves act as a sort of backup, and include copies of important data such as procedures. The displays themselves are designed to be fully redundant, so if a single display failed, the other 2 could fully take its place. Even if we were to experience a failure of all 3 displays, the crew has a button panel that can be used to initiate emergency responses, and ground commanding is also possible. -Jarrett

Q: In the UI of Crew Dragon and tablets how do you plan for use of gloved/non-gloved hands?

A: The UI takes into consideration the conditions of the vehicle during all phases of flight. This includes the shaking of the vehicle on ascent/descent where crew is also wearing a helmet, suit, and gloves. All buttons in the UI have a minimum size which we do not go past and which still works with thicker gloved fingers. In addition there are a wide variety of UI/UX decisions which were informed by phase of flight and cabin environment. For example, the location of the primary navigation elements are at the bottom of the UI because the crew must lift their arms up to interact with the displays. We designed the interface with as much padding and white space as possible to let the information breathe and be as readable as possible. More important UI elements like the command buttons are in the top of the interface outside of high activity areas so that interacting with them was always intentional. The Forward View features a unique circular contrast filter that allows for all of the digitals in the interface to be easily visible on top of varied video lighting conditions. All units are readable even if the video feed behind the UI is pure white or black. We also performed multiple vibration testing events with male and female participants of all ages and heights who wore actual crew helmets and sat in actual crew seats. The seats were placed on a vibration table to simulate ascent/descent conditions. While the seat was shaking, participants would use an Xbox controller to play a custom game that tested the readability of word &amp; number sequences with randomized font sizes, colors, and text positions that were also shaking randomly in the UI. This helped confirm that the readability decisions we had made about fonts, sizes, icons, spacing and colors held up under extreme environmental conditions. It also showed us that essentially every Sci-Fi Movie Interface was unrealistic and would be unreadable under extreme conditions. - Jarrett

Q: Can you show us bits of the user interface? How does informational design help triage issues that may arise?

A: For the control interfaces, we aim for a 'quiet-dark' philosophy–if the vehicle is behaving nominally, the interface is streamlined and minimal, but still shows overall system status. This way, we visually prioritize off-nominal information, while allowing the operators and crew to maintain system context. Information design is a challenge for more engineering-oriented interfaces. We lean heavily on backend software and automated analysis to prioritize the most important data to display. - Asher

Q: What software changes are you going to make to support Inspiration4 that aren't on the past Crew Dragon flights?

A: We are making a number of software updates for Inspiration4 to support new capabilities on the vehicle. This includes software to support the new cupola we are adding to the vehicle as well as rolling in updates to make prelaunch operations smoother. However Dragon is a very capable vehicle so much of the existing software will just work with the Inspiration4 mission design. - Jarrett

Q: How has JS in space worked out on Crew Dragon? Were there any changes to the UI/UX the team has made due to in-flight experience?

A: One part that is really exciting about working on Dragon is talking to crews and learning from their experiences operating the vehicle. We collect the crew's feedback on usability, and are continually working to improve the operations of the vehicle from their perspective. This includes making updates to the UI such as adding new features, updating views, and adjusting procedures.- Jarrett

### Starlink Q&amp;A

Q: I’ve pushed a software update out to a couple of hundred cloud servers for web applications - but I can’t contemplate how complex pushing an update out to a constellation would be. Could you elaborate on the software/firmware update processes for starlink? Are releases incremental across the constellation? How frequently are updated/releases made? Do you provision your own tooling to orchestrate releases or utilise existing code deployment and testing tools?

A: We try to roll out new builds to our entire fleet of assets (satellites, ground stations, user terminals, and WiFi routers) once per week. Every device is periodically checking in with our servers to see if it's supposed to fetch a new build, and if one is available it will download and apply the update during the ideal time to minimize impact to users. This means we can really easily test builds on a small pool and move to exponential deployments by changing a few configurations in a database. We've designed our system so that each asset (which can contain dozens of separate computers) updates atomically by first fetching a new package to a central node, and having all of the other computers fetch updates from that central node. Every device also retains a backup copy of the last good software so if anything goes wrong (like a radiation induced power fault) during the update it automatically recovers by booting into that backup.  Nearly all of our deployment and testing tools are built in house, mostly because our architecture is so unique and the various constraints we have to work with would require significant customization of off the shelf tools. Natalie

Q: What are some plans to make production of the Starlink dishys more scaleable?

A: For the production scale we're looking to achieve with Starlink kits, we've been building from the ground up for much of what we're doing here, growing into a new factory with new software systems that have been designed with Starlink's planned scale in mind. The software team is colocated in the factory with everyone else that is thinking about this problem, and they have spent time building Starlinks on the line to ensure they've understood the high rate manufacturing processes as well as they can.  For a factory producing at our desired target rate we're looking to have a highly integrated factory system, with automation, robots, people, and software working together. The guiding principle is generally to keep looking for how much we can simplify what we're doing. - Kristine

Q: In general terms, can you describe the complexity of Starlink’s telemetry system with fixed ground terminals, and how much more complexity is added by in-motion use cases like boats or Rvs?

A: The biggest challenge we have to solve when thinking about fixed ground terminals is how to allocate ""beams"" from satellites to each spot on earth we want to serve. We have to take into account how many users need bandwidth, radio interference from other satellites (including ourselves!), and field of view constraints.
Motion does not generally add much complexity for the telemetry system. It does present some interesting challenges when it comes to satellites for example which are out of contact from the ground in parts of their orbit. This means our telemetry system has to be resilient to out of order and/or late arriving telemetry.
Moving targets require us to solve the attitude determination problem (which way is dishy pointing?) quickly and continuously. They also change the number of users are in a given spot at once, which affects how much bandwidth is needed there. - Kristine

Q: The transition between Starlink satellites is so smooth its unnoticeable. How have you guys managed to make this happen? It seems like the time the satellites change, and when dishy rotates, and ground stations and everything change this would be noticed.

A: The starlink system is built to be super dynamic since our satellites are moving so fast (&gt;7km/s) that a user isn't connected to the same satellite for more than a few minutes. Each user terminal can only talk to one satellite at a time, so our user to satellite links utilize electrically steered beams to instantaneously change targets from satellite to satellite, and we temporarily buffer traffic in anticipation of this ""handover."" Our satellite to gateway links use mechanically steered antenna, so we have to account for movement time and make sure we don't ""let go"" of one connection until we've securely established the next one. A good visual is to picture our satellites ""walking"" their gateway connections across the earth as they fly by. - Jeanette

Q: I’ve pushed a software update out to a couple of hundred cloud servers for web applications - but I can’t contemplate how complex pushing an update out to a constellation would be. Could you elaborate on the software/firmware update processes for starlink? Are releases incremental across the constellation? How frequently are updated/releases made? Do you provision your own tooling to orchestrate releases or utilise existing code deployment and testing tools?

A: We try to roll out new builds to our entire fleet of assets (satellites, ground stations, user terminals, and WiFi routers) once per week.

Natalie

Q: Could you tell us more about Starlink’s telemetry system? What problems did you face and how did you solve them?

A: When we were getting started we already had a great in-house telemetry system but it has a core concept of a ""run"" - a definite start and stop time for a given dataset. Starlink doesn't fit that model because there are many devices that are always on and can send data out of order or with significant delay so these were some of the first problems we had to solve. Along the way some of the most interesting challenges have been around fault domains and fault tolerance - how do we make sure parts of the system have as much availability as possible? If one set of devices emits information that breaks expectations, how can we limit the impact of that to as small of a subset of software as possible so other datasets continue to be processed? We also chose to not keep all data but created a powerful system to aggregate information over time as well as age out information when it is no longer useful.  - Kristine

Q: How do you guarantee the alignment of transmitter and receiver for an intersatellite laser links? Is it enough just to calculate the angles from the expected position of the satellites, or do you have to use some kind of active homing?

A: The pointing tolerances for inter-satellite laser links are quite tight, so you're correct in supposing that just calculating the angles from the expected position of the satellites isn't good enough. To help put the magnitude of the pointing problem into perspective, in angular tolerances the problem we're trying to solve is as hard as trying to shoot a laser from LA and hit the Empire State building in NYC. When bringing up a laser link, we first begin by pointing based on the expected angle, and then orchestrate an acquisition sequence to get consistent power on both sides. - Jeanette

Q: How do you manage the different versions of software with the different versions of boosters/starlink sats? Aren't the hardware teams always making upgrades and modifications to the design which would create the need to have individual code versions for each singular mechanical iteraction?

A: For Starlink, we try as hard as possible to have a single software load for all satellites, regardless of the specific versions of each sub-component on any given vehicle. We do this by making clean separations between hardware interface layers and the ""business"" logic on various components. The software reads various hardware identifiers to understand what types of each thing we've got and adapts its behavior accordingly. - Jeanette

Q: What were some challenges faced when trying to update the software on the orbiting Starlink satellites? What level physics should one be at to start working as a software engineer at spacex?

A: One of the most interesting challenges in designing a software update system for satellites is to build a system that is tolerant to an arbitrary fault (like a power down or memory corruption) at any point in the process. We generally use a primary/backup update scheme to solve that and to ensure that the default recovery strategy is to load up known good software that we know can do an on-the-fly update. We don't have hard and fast requirements for physics as a software engineer, but most people have some familiarity with both mechanics and electromagnetics. - Jeanette",1621115834

We will put this thread into contest mode and announce the winner in a few days time.

The winner will be allowed to post their picture directly on r/SpaceX and will get a special flair.

## Rules:

[r/SpaceX Discusses [April 2021]](/r/spacex/comments/mhj2z3/rspacex_thread_index_and_general_discussion_april/) for discussion of subjects other than Starship development.

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starship development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

#About the mission

SpaceX is going to launch 60 Starlink satellites to Low Earth Orbit on a Falcon 9 rocket. This will be the 21st operational Starlink mission to date.

##Official mission overview

SpaceX is targeting Sunday, March 14 for launch of 60 Starlink satellites from Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The instantaneous window is at 6:01 a.m. EDT, or 10:01 UTC. The Falcon 9 first stage rocket booster supporting this mission previously supported launch of Crew Dragon’s first demonstration mission, RADARSAT Constellation Mission, SXM-7, and five Starlink missions. Following stage separation, SpaceX will land Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Of Course I Still Love You” droneship, which will be located in the Atlantic Ocean. Falcon 9’s fairing previously flew on the Transporter-1 mission. [-&gt;Expected event timeline](link)

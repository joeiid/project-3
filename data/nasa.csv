Like, I've read some things that say that those who didn't work at NASA had no idea the Columbia might've had a problem, but I've heard other things that people *did* know that something had gone seriously wrong at the launch. 

I think when it comes to NASA, some people knew more than others, but idk. I'm more confused on the civilian aspect. Was it reported on beforehand as a possibility? Cause both my parents insist that they knew before it happened that something went wrong and they might not make it home. I'm so confused.

nasa,umrmlx,theergscaresme,Re: 2018-19 NASA Center&gt;FFRDC Conversion Proposal,"Hey everyone, looking for information here as the internet has run out.   


1) I'm looking at the relationship between NASA and FFRDC's, with the only primary link being JPL. A few others like MIT Lincoln Lab and MITRE have worked with the government on space-related matters/projects; are there any other FFRDCs with a high level of specialization in SPACE or projects assisting space policy/missions?  


2) In 2018/19 there was a proposal relating to the budget that proposed the conversion of NASA field centers into FFRDC's to increase effectiveness. From what I understood this was shot down 15 years earlier in 2004 because it would effectively put those people out of a job until it was taken over by contractors not civil servants.   


NASA's FY19 Budget included this proposal tied in with a proposal to eliminate STMD.   


What ended up happening? Specifically looking for info relating to the FFRDC proposal and current status of NASA/FFRDC relations outside of JPL.",1652213685

nasa,udgs6b,AXELLENOX,Mismatch of Moon sizes?,"Hi, first of all my English is bad :(

I just saw an Animation of Nasa that shows some actual pictures which were taken by a satellite that show the dark side of the moon. Here is the link to it:

[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/from-a-million-miles-away-nasa-camera-shows-moon-crossing-face-of-earth](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/from-a-million-miles-away-nasa-camera-shows-moon-crossing-face-of-earth)

And as you all know, this one is the Apollo 11's moonrise photo which was from the surface of the moon:

[https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/187/apollo-11-mission-image-view-of-moon-limb-with-earth-on-the-horizon/](https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/187/apollo-11-mission-image-view-of-moon-limb-with-earth-on-the-horizon/)

I just compared these two images and realized that; sizes of the moons are different. One was taken from behind and the earth still looks a lot bigger in that perspective. Meanwhile in the Apollo 11's photo, the earth is tiny tho the photo was taken from the surface, which is closer to the earth.

What am I missing here?",1651101542

Do you guys know if the nasa administrator's correspondence (with congress, the president etc) is archived somewhere? Or other useful sources? 

On the same note, I often heard that NASA wanted to prevent Russia's experts from leaving the country and possibly work for other nations, but I haven't seen anything official about that concern... Any ideas?

While I understand Gas planets dont really have a surface, but usually have liquid and possibly a rocky core, will we ever develop the technology to see inside the atmosphere of a Gas planet?

Even if its just a quick snap shot before the voyager is destroyed?

Or no? 

Are gas planets to hostile, where no manmade equipment could survive on entering in the atmosphere?

Maybe it‚Äôs pointless considering we‚Äôd only see clouds, and thats only if the light from the sun can penetrate into atmosphere to provide light.

I dont know too much about space, so if I said anything wrong please correct , but dont insult!

nasa,ucmzog,Romulan-war-bird,"My grandma used to work at NASA in the 60s, can any current employees help me wish her a happy birthday?","She still talks about how it was the most fun she‚Äôs ever had in her life. She took dictation and wrote papers for engineers there, and she was the only woman present at some of the Saturn V meetings where she was recording questions and answers for the engineers who asked her to go with them. 
Unfortunately, a lot of the gifts and memorabilia she was given from there got stolen or lost when she had to move, so she doesn‚Äôt have much left of her time working at NASA. I‚Äôve been thinking about what to do for her birthday this year, and I thought it would mean a lot to her if I could get some current employees to send her a birthday card and thank her for her time there. She‚Äôs turning 97 and has outlived all but one of her friends from NASA now, so I know it would really make her happy to get something from there again.

I had initially sent an email to public inquiries, but idk how long it will take them to respond so I think I‚Äôll have better luck getting a response from someone on Reddit.

Also, I figured I would start learning math up to calculus online before even going back to school.

The model is going to be 3D printed, so I don't need to see every single pipe and connection. Just the main connections between fuel\\ox turbopump and the combustion chamber. I've almost finished modeling it but there's still a lot of uncertainty because I'm not really sure where pipes connect and the proportions between components.

Do you know any footage where those components are clearly visible so I can use it as a reference?

Let's say a qualified candidate (scientist/engineer/physician/etc.) was the mayor of their town, but ran under a political party, or perhaps, made policy decisions that not everyone agrees with. Or less extreme, let's say someone was a leader of some group pushing for public policy change on a divisive political issue and did interviews with the press.

nasa,tpjijn,renwill,Advice on mock NASA proposal for a class,"My college-level planetary science class has a final project where groups of students are asked to write  a \~15 page mock NASA proposal with a fair amount of realism -- we need to come up with a mission that fits within a $700 million dollar budget (more like $600 since we have to keep 15% in reserve), with discussion on things such as instruments, science targets, launch vehicle, mission lifetime, employee pay, and contingency plans. I figure some folks here might have more knowledge than me and could make suggestions.

My group wants to do a mission to Saturn, with a particular focus on Enceladus and Dione probably. With our budget we definitely couldn't replicate Cassini (nor should we be attempting to replicate anything anyways)

I'm trying to (somehow) keep things within budget, but the problem is, **I can barely find any info online on how much individual things should cost!** I'm guessing that info is usually classified? How much would you expect a mass spectrometer to cost? a magnetometer? telemetry?

Any ballpark estimates are much appreciated -- our professor just said ""better equipment costs more"" and didn't want to give any helpful hints lol. General suggestions would also be much appreciated.

Additional info:

\- Our launch is 'free' so that's not factored into budget. It would itself be hundreds of millions of dollars if it was

\-We get a free Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG)",1648386234

There are plans to release it on iOS in the future aswell. 

The app uses the original audio from the NASA missions for additional immersion, as well as music from the talented [Scott Buckley](https://www.scottbuckley.com.au/).

Check it out and let me know what you think! I would recommend darkening your room and wearing headphones. Have fun!

*If you would like to use this app for educational purposes, I will happily make it available to you and your students for free.*

Don't hestitate to ask me questions.

They supposedly had an astronaut program that only had 2 final candidates, only 1 of which went to space, Yi So-yeon, who went to the ISS on a Russian Soyuz in 2008.

Japan, on the other hand, has had many examples of international cooperation, even flying on the Space Shuttle.

nasa,t7tjsx,deadridge,Who watches for asteroids?,"I'm a writer working on a project involving a character who has spotted an asteroid on a collision path with Earth, likely to create something similar upon impact to the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor. Unfortunately, my understanding of NASA and the professionals who work there is quite limited.

In trying to place this person in the world, I've been trying to determine what sort of people would actually in a position to do this. I have seen a few things online, but they don't go much into the actual people who work their or their responsibilities:

* CNEOS (Center for Near-Earth Object Studies) in Pasadena, CA.
* The Near-Earth Object Observations Program, including the NEOWISE Project and the Infrared Telescope Facility 
* The PDCO (Planetary Defense Coordination Office)

So, here is the question: What sort of employee would be most likely to spot and analyze the trajectory of the asteroid? Specifically, which program would probably employ them; where is their office; what is their job title; is the job junior, staff, senior, private, government, requiring security clearance, etc.? Is there anything else I should know about their duties? They're obviously not just staring at a screen all day waiting to see a blip. :) 

Anything anyone knows about the job (less so the actual programs) would be super helpful!",1646551323

nasa,t2wz2v,some_1guy,How do you think the invasion of Ukraine will affect future NASA international cooperation?,"I see this as going down one of two paths:

1. Once peace is struck we're able to return to a working relationship on a scientific level without the higher-ups of both administrations throwing much of a tantrum. Having a cooperative space program is a benefit for all   countries involved and allows us to do more cool things.
2. This marks the beginning of another big east-west divide between Russia/China and NASA/ESA/JAXA. Personally I think this is more likely   because the administrators on both sides will be too fired up politically to do anything that signals cooperation. Honestly, I get that too - the entire world should be disgusted by Russia's actions. it will be a long time before they regain any sort of political legitimacy   again.

This is also  just  coming from the mind of someone who'd still like to be an astronaut one  day and is trying to decide if it's still worth it to intensely study  Russian. As much as I hate to say it, I think that the  conflict in  Ukraine is going to make a serious negative impact on the state of space exploration on the governmental level.

nasa,sxqhuu,sawsalitos,Why do rockets fly so fast into space and not slowly?,"Hello all, 

I have always wondered why rockets leave the earth at several thousand km / h. 

Well, there is a certain escape velocity necessary for a body to escape the gravitational field of the Earth, but I always thought that this referred to ballistic projectiles without additional power. 

For airplanes, I can understand a minimum velocity, since the velocity creates some lift, which counteracts the gravitational force.

But a rocket could for example also leave the earth with 1000 km /h? That would take much longer and is not really intuitive, since one thinks emotionally that the fuel runs out faster.

But let's say I generate only half of the thrust, do I then also consume only half of the fuel? Or is this ratio not linear, so that you have to fly so fast not to run out of fuel?  


If that is the case, I wonder what about the inertial forces. I don't know how long a rocket accelerates to a stationary speed, but I assume that the rocket accelerates relatively slowly and thus a lot of fuel is consumed to overcome the inertial forces. 

Wouldn't it be possible to accelerate quickly to 1000 km/h and then continue flying at a constant speed?",1645439671

This thread will serve as an FAQ and megathread - any posts regarding summer 2022 (including Pathways) internships will be removed and directed here. You may post questions in the comments here and the community will do our best to answer them; however your best bet is to email the NASA internships staff for an official answer. 

Overall Internship Website:
https://intern.nasa.gov

OSTEM/NIFS Internship Website: https://nasacentral.force.com/s/explore-opportunities

When are the application deadlines for Pathways Internships? The application window for pathways internships starting Summer 2022 was February 7-11. The application window for pathways internships starting Fall 2022 is April 11-15. All positions are listed on nasa.gov/careers/pathways and must be applied for on USAjobs.gov

When is the application deadline for OSTEM/NIFS Summer 2022 internships? For best consideration apply by March 4, 2022.

When will I be contacted for an interview? Not every position holds interviews. Some mentors have already begun scheduling interviews, while some will wait until applications close. Please be patient. 

When will I know if I got a position? Some mentors have already begun selecting interns, while others have not started. Please be patient. 

Will I get an email if I'm not accepted to a position? It's possible, but not definitive. Hundreds of applicants apply for the same position, so it is not always feasible to email everyone who was not chosen. Some positions may also have become unavailable, and no one selected. 

Do I have to enter my references on each application? Yes. This is a new internship system and certain things are not transferring between applications, including references. Your references will recieve separate emails for each position you apply to. 

When do the internships start? June 6, 2022. There may be flexibility depending on the specific position.

Will the internships be virtual or in person? This is a position by position decision - most internships will likely be virtual but very limited numbers may be in person. 

Feel free to ask any other questions and we will do our best to answer them or refer you to the NASA internships staff for a better answer.",1645111734

I would assume) unanimous decision that they would need to retire the ISS by 2030. We have tried to look at articles released today to see if anyone mentions it, but we haven‚Äôt found anything. There are several countries that work together to keep the ISS running, right? So did they all decide together? Does NASA actually ‚Äúrun things‚Äù and came upon this decision by itself? There was one article I found that said Russia is planning to retire their part by 2025, so perhaps they all just kind of decided it was time? Did they all hold a meeting and vote?

A little about me, I am a 23 year old recent College Grad from Nigeria with a Computer Science Bachelors Degree. I also occasionally volunteer on a B-17 restoration project which I drive around. I'm thinking about going back into college to get into geology, astronomy or maybe some form of planetary science, or if they don't have a planetary science degree, so maybe environmental science?, Would Absoloutley love to work with the Mars rovers and help the Mars team. I want to be part of the next Apollo, I want to help get a man on Mars. I know Im not an MIT grad, or a Ivy league kid straight out of Cal tech, or Harvard but I'm definitely a great person definitely willing to get out into the field and get dirty/ brave bitter cold harsh conditions/ go out of my league buy donuts or whatever just to help be a team player. I will do whatever it takes to get a Job at NASA I know there is Usajobs.gov, but I find it is slightly confusing to navigate and could probably use a bit of help. If there is any current NASA employees Im wondering, How did you get into NASA, and what advise would you give me?",1643774718

It seems like NASA is dropping little hints here and there that Glover will be landing on the Moon in a few years.

nasa,s5yvh8,medicalsheepskin1,This is Jupiter.,"It‚Äôs also a big ball of hydrogen.

Basically, if an object is primarily composed of hydrogen, it will start undergoing fusion once it reaches a certain mass. We call those objects ‚Äústars‚Äù. However, the line between a star and a planet is not clear. There are small star-like objects known as brown dwarfs which are either too small to undergo fusion or if they do, are too cold to emit strongly in visible light. However, if they don‚Äôt orbit another star, they‚Äôre not planets by definition. Astronomers tend to call them ‚Äúbrown dwarfs‚Äù because, well, they‚Äôre small, brownish balls of hydrogen.

&amp;#x200B;

Just like Jupiter.

*Edit*: For those of you complaining that Jupiter isn‚Äôt a star, you‚Äôre missing the point. Yes, stars fuse hydrogen and Jupiter doesn‚Äôt. And, yes, I agree that defining ‚Äústar‚Äù based on nuclear fusion is the best possible definition.

However, that doesn‚Äôt affect my answer.

Jupiter is a ball of hydrogen.

If it was about 13 to 15 times more massive, it would be able to fuse deuterium and we‚Äôd call it a brown dwarf. However, it would STILL be a ball of hydrogen.

If it was about 80 times more massive, it would fuse hydrogen and we‚Äôd call it a star. However, it would STILL be a ball of hydrogen.

In other words: if Jupiter was bigger, it would have enough mass to produce a fusion reaction and we‚Äôd call it a star.

The mass of the object is the only thing that makes a difference, so please stop being pedantic and saying I don‚Äôt understand the difference between planets and stars.",1642407301

nasa,s3mymf,medicalsheepskin1,Titan is better than Mars for human colonization.,"Titan has some advantages over Mars, that potentially can make Titan a better alternative for human colonization.

**The Titan advantage:**

1. **Titan has a thick atmosphere made primarily of nitrogen.** The pressure at the surface is about 1.45 times Earth's atmospheric pressure. The Martian atmosphere, on the other hand, is very thin. It is less than 1% of Earth's atmospheric pressure at sea level and is composed primarily of carbon dioxide. Titan's thicker atmosphere has a number of advantages:

* Airlocks are a lot simpler to design. The pressure inside a craft or a habitat can be equal to the pressure outside. The main thing you'll need to worry about is the cold.
* And ‚Ä¶ you don't need to worry much about pressurizing your habitat or EVA suit. You also don't need to worry too much about air leaks (a little extra nitrogen is harmless and humans can live a normal life at 1.45 atmospheric pressure).
* The combination of low gravity (14% of Earth) and thick atmosphere means that air travel will be very easy to implement. Winged airplanes and zeppelins will work on Titan even better than on Earth. (Using electricity, as there is no free oxygen.) With artificial wings, humans can fly on Titan using their own **muscle** power. How cool is that?

1. **Titan gets much lower radiation.** It has less galactic cosmic radiation because of the protection of Saturn's magnetic field, and Titan's thick atmosphere. Titan gets less powerful solar flares due to its distance from the sun. The lower radiation means people can live on Titan's surface for as long as they want, unlike the limited duration that Martian colonists can spend on the Martian surface. On Mars, colonists will have to hide under the surface most of their lives to protect themselves from radiation.
2. &amp;#x200B;

1. **Titan has more water, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen.** Minerals are important to support life. A large percentage of Titan's surface is made of solid water ice. Titan may have liquid water under the surface.
2. **Titan is close to other moons, such as Enceladus**, that may host life.
3. **Titan has nicer scenery.** It's the only celestial body with liquid lakes. If you chose to live in the upper atmosphere, in a zeppelin, or a city supported by hydrogen balloons, you'll be able to see Saturn. (Hydrogen balloons will be safe because Titan has no free oxygen, so no risk of fire.)",1642147161

So my two cents on his book that I just finished:

Chock full of realism with actual people, things, and others from the past. You could see this book as a alt-history story, actually. I was pretty surprised to learn of things that existed, like Russia's Almaz. I appreciated the details that Hadfield put in about not just some of the things done in space, but even on the ground and in the air in different aircraft. His visceral description of an Apollo takeoff made me feel the awe of such power again. His love of aviation is pretty plain to see here, but that's OK because I share in that love, so I was happy to read about the main character's going through the motions of flying even just a Cessna.

Plot-wise, it's a thriller, although it does have a bit of a slow start. The pace really picks up as it goes on. The only thing I will say about the ending without spoiling is that it certainly was a bit of a surprise for me, but that's all right. I do like a good book that doesn't stick to formula, even if it's not what you're rooting for.

I give this book a solid 4 out of 5 stars. A definite fun read for anyone, but especially those who like spaceflight and aviation.",1641501564

\### FAQs

&amp;#x200B;

\* Why is the percentage of distance complete so high, won't it reach the orbit much sooner? 

  \* Webb's speed is at its peak while connected to the push of the launch vehicle. Its speed begins to slow rapidly after separation as it \[coasts up hill climbing the gravity ridge from Earth to its orbit around L2\]([https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Lagrangian\_points\_equipotential.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Lagrangian_points_equipotential.png)). Note on the timeline that Webb reaches the altitude of the moon in \~2.5 days (which is \~25% of its trip in terms of distance but only \~8% in time). 

\* How long until we'll be able to see images?

  \* It will take around 6 months from launch to get the first science back.

\* Why is it taking so long for everything to happen?

  \* In short, there's a lot that has to be done, everything has to be done correctly the first time, and some of the steps just take a while. For example, the mirrors have to be calibrated which is done by small motors that move at roughly the speed of grass growing (thanks Scott Manley). Many other things have to be done slowly to as to not affect the spacecraft's attitude.

\* Why hasn't ""x"" happened yet, the timeline says it's due?

  \* There can be many reasons, but the timeline shows the planned timing, which can change during flight.

\* During the launch, why did the altitude decrease for a time?

  \* They explained \[during the launch coverage\]([https://youtu.be/7nT7JGZMbtM?t=5796](https://youtu.be/7nT7JGZMbtM?t=5796)) that this was for a gravity assist.

\* What if something goes wrong, can they send someone or something to fix it?

  \* JWST was not designed to be able to be serviced. At the present time, we simply don't have the technology available to reach it.",1640820622

The technical expertise required to design and build this thing from physical science to the origami to fold it is incredible. I feel like everything has been building up to this, and we're going to make some significant discoveries in the coming years. 

I can't wait, I'm so excited. I don't know why everyone everywhere isn't celebrating. The last couple years of COVID and the bad news with climate change has soured my optimism of late. The JWT has lifted my hopes for humanity yet again.  As a kid who grew up on Star Trek and science fiction I just wanted to say thank you.

nasa,rlifl9,lordOfTheLoneliness,Is it possible for planets/moons like Enceladus to offer needed conditions for supporting life of humans?,"Considering if icy planets/moons like these would have proper atmosphere, similar to our Earth so humans could breathe normally.

I'm showing a huge interest into extraterrestrial life.

According to some articles I found on internet, science says (correct me if I'm mistaken) that icy planets/moons are more likely to show signs of extraterrestrial life that any other planets/moons.

The reason why I'm asking this is because I'm trying to design my own, imaginary, fantasy planet.
It's preferable for me that it has icy surface, similar to the surface of Enceladus and Pluto.

So what is your opinion? What do you think?

Will a planet of this type offer more conditions for life than, let's say, desert planet?",1640104505

nasa,rcuh6b,stemmisc,"If Starship/etc brings cost-per-kg down a lot in the future, would it be pragmatic to launch some big, cheap ""repeater station(s)"" out near other planet(s), so any future probes to those planets wouldn't need as powerful transmitters/receivers once the repeater station(s) were in operation?","I guess several things I am curious about:

- Does being near the Earth (with all the ""noise"" on the EM spectrum we produce) make it harder for detectors on our side of the equation (here on/near Earth, that is) to detect very faint signals from very small, weak, probe transmissions (i.e. from some little probe exploring a moon of Neptune or something)?

- Does the atmosphere (on either end, i.e. if it was on Titan, or one of the other planets that have atmospheres), or, our own atmosphere, here on Earth, weaken the signal strength much as the signal passes through the atmosphere? (I guess that aspect wouldn't matter much on the Earth side, since we have tons of satellites up in space that can just function as repeaters for us in that regard already, but, on the other side of the equation if the planet/moon being explored had an atmosphere, I guess it might matter)

- And then, just, in the more general sense, of weak signals vs long distances, I wonder if putting a ""big, dumb, cheap"" receiver/transmitter workhorse ""repeater station"" (basically a big cube shaped thing with some big dishes on all sides of it facing in various directions, so it could receive weak signals from a nearby planet/moons and then repeat the signal at much higher strength out to Earth, would be helpful in the long run, in terms of allowing NASA's probes, explorers, scopes, etc to not have to waste as much mass, battery power, size, etc on signal receiving and transmitting gear, since any probes/etc launched out once the repeater station(s) were placed out by the other planet(s) would merely need to be strong enough to send and receive signals to the repeater, rather than to Earth.

- Depending on the answer to the first question, I guess that would also either bring up, or not bring up, another question of whether it would be useful to just have one really big and powerful repeater-station of this sort, put out in whatever the most useful general far-out spot would be, I dunno, somewhere near Saturn or somewhere, distance-wise, that was used for all the far away planets (not just Saturn, I mean), or, to instead send a few somewhat smaller (but still fairly big) ones out, individually, to Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and/or any other useful places.

- Also, wonder if there would be any benefit in regards to line-of-sight issues, and using laser linking or something, via these repeater stations giving a benefit in that regard somehow or something maybe, for certain sorts of missions

If the launch costs were low, and cost per kg was a lot lower than what it is now, and the repeater stations weren't too expensive, and just had that one single purpose, then, I wonder if maybe the ""one time fee"" of sorts, of putting it/them out there, and then from that point onward, basically permanently getting that signal-boosting benefit from them, would be useful, and worth-it, from that point onward, in terms of it being easier to get away with building probes differently from that point onward due to not having to worry as much about the receiver/transmitter strength being so high on the probes/etc of all the future missions to other planetary bodies in our solar system.

Anyway, I'm pretty new to astronomy stuff, so I'm not really sure if any of this would be useful at all or make any sense, so, this is more of a question, rather than a suggestion, but yea, just something I was wondering about.",1639093055

https://preview.redd.it/sewuxdr8dc481.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21e39559f20474992a370832311c16994f99e7a3

The Dragonfly lander is a dual quadcopter drone that will traverse the surface of Saturn‚Äôs largest moon Titan searching for biochemical signs of early life. Titan is an ocean world with an atmospheric composition prime for development of the chemicals needed for the basis of life as we know it. It is expected that Dragonfly will operate for at least 2.7 years on Titan and give valuable insights into astrobiology and flights on other planetary bodies.

**Traversal**

Dragonfly will weigh approximately 900 kg and will be able to cover 10s of miles in under an hour. This is much more distance than any previous lander and this kind of distance is thanks to Titan having a gravitational pull 1/7 of Earth‚Äôs and an atmosphere 4 times as dense as Earth‚Äôs.

Like the recent Mars drone Ingenuity, Dragonfly will fly autonomously, using LIDAR and a variety of cameras to analyze the ground. Dragonfly will ‚Äúhop‚Äù from its current to potential landing site, scouting it for hazards and relaying that data 70-90 light minutes away to NASA to determine viability. A Titan day is equivalent to about 15.9 Earth days, and NASA is hoping to achieve a single hop per Titan day.

**Entry and Descent**

If the ‚Äú7 minutes of terror‚Äù regarding the Mars landing missions rings a bell, well get ready for the 100 minutes of uneasiness. Due to Titan‚Äôs thick atmosphere, Dragonfly will be descending for quite a long time, especially on it‚Äôs drogue chute. Once about a kilometer above the service, the drone will release from the lander, and use powered flight to reach a suitable landing spot. This landing will be extra tricky as there will be no engineers selecting a site, the drone will have to identify one on its own.

**Instrumentation**

Dragonfly will carry a mass spectrometer to identify any compounds it can get it‚Äôs hands on, a neutron/gamma-ray spectrometer for looking at surface composition, a suite of sensors for recording meteorological and geological/seismic data, and of course the cameras Dragonfly will use to navigate.

**Communication**

As there are no permanent satellites orbiting Titan, Dragonfly will rely on Direct-To-Earth communication, making use of the large dish on its top to send and receive signals directly to and from Earth. During Titan‚Äôs nights, Dragonfly will not have line-of-sight to Earth and therefore won‚Äôt be able to communicate, instead performing experiments autonomously while teams on Earth look at its previously sent data.

**Power**

A Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (which utilizes the decay of Plutonium) will be used to generate power and heat for the lander. A similar device was used on the Mars Curiosity rover and is currently on the International Space Station. The heat from this will be much needed as Titan‚Äôs surface can be around -290 degrees Fahrenheit. While in general it is good for electronics to be cool, this temperature can definitely be too much for some of the instruments so a big challenge will be to make sure they are properly heated.

While Dragonfly isn‚Äôt slated to leave Earth till 2026 and arrive on Titian till 2034, I believe that Dragonfly will be an incredible mission that deserves to be heard. I was inspired to make this after listening to a talk from one of the lead systems engineers on the entry and descent system and found this mission to be absolutely fascinating. I hope this mission interests you as well.

I am currently working on a school project where we have to design a rocket facility, defining what machines are required, the amount of material needed, and the time required for each operation to be completed. The facility is to create a 3 stage rocket.

However, I am struggling to find any information on the type of curing process used. The panels used are 7000 series aluminum.

I've narrowed it down to one of these 4: air curing, thermosetting, photosetting, or chemical setting. I personally think it would be air curing, but am unsure. Does anyone know where I could find more information about the curing process used on typical rocket barrels/aluminum panels?

nasa,r8at4g,stemmisc,"Are there any videos (or simulated launch profiles) that show the delta-V stats for all 3 stages of the Atlas V launch of New Horizons? I'd like to know how much delta-V they got out of each stage. I know how much it ended with, but I'd like to see the breakdown per stage","I've seen some other launches, to just LEO or something I think, where it seemed like the 1st stage (in 551 config) of the Atlas V did the vast majority of the work, in terms of delta-V getting up to something like 13,000+ mph, with the Centaur only doing the last 3,000-4,000 mph of delta-V in putting something into orbit.

Which, I will admit surprised me a little, since it's sort of an exact reverse of something like, say, a Falcon 9, where with that one the first stage does more like 4,500-ish mph of delta-V, and the 2nd stage does the remaining 13,000 mph of delta-V.

But, then again, these were LEO insertion launches I was watching, so, I'm not sure how that affects everything.

Whereas with specifically new Horizons, that was an earth (and solar system) escape launch, so, I figure maybe that's the type of launch that would give me the best idea of just how much delta-V you can get out of the thing if just going purely for that, with no mitigating factors (maybe I'm wrong about this).

(And yea, I know it had a small solid fuel 3rd stage, as well, for the New Horizons launch).

Also, I am curious if there are any sort of delta-V comparison charts that compare and contrast all the medium-lift and heavy-lift rockets in terms of how much delta-V they would be able to give, in a 2-stage, or 3-stage setup, to, say, a 500kg payload, or 1,000 kg payload or something like that, if putting it on a deep space trajectory, so I could compare the launch vehicles against each other for something like that.

Also, if something like that doesn't exist, but maybe some of you can give me some tips on how I might be able to crunch the numbers myself, to get pretty good estimates on it myself, then that would be cool, too.

VIPER has what look like four little somwhat fixed wheels vs 6 independant ones. At the same time the two types of rovers need to deal with what I think is similar, rocky, dusty, uneven and inclined terrain. I think there are other design similarities. The vehicles are roughly the same size (1.4 x 1.4 x 2m and 1.5 x 2.3 x 1.6m, respectively,) though illustrations make VIPER look more top-heavy. Also, the weight is virtually identical when accounting for the gravity of the moon vs. Mars, which I think plays into wheel traction. Both move slowly, so I don‚Äôt think the differing mass/momentum is a concern.

I‚Äôm guessing that VIPER builds on experience with the Mars rover chassis. What are the reasons for this change from 6 to 4 wheels and no visible suspension? If NASA was to send another rover to Mars, would it also have 4 wheels?",1638207764

nasa,r3a708,awsumguy76801,Titan Methane lake sample return?,"There was a proposed mission to send a boat to Titan's lakes to study the environment but it got cancelled. Lets say we do something more crazy. How about a boat to land on Titans lakes, collect a sample of liquid methane and launch into Titan orbit where it will meet up with a retrieval spacecraft like the mars rock return mission perseverance is doing but with liquid methane. The return spacecraft will come back from Saturn with the liquid Methane kept in a capsule to keep it liquid (obviously) and scientists could study it for possible microbes. One major concern though is that if there is in fact life in the lakes of Titan if the return probe crashes on Earth these alien bacteria could contaminate Earth and cause mass extinction or vice versa with Earth organisms on Titan. So we would have to be extra careful with this mission I'm talking full biohazard containment like the Apollo astronauts had to go through. Anyway in cost terms the boat wouldn't be able to move so more like a raft because it would be more expensive, the raft would simply float there and collect samples and wait for the return craft and maybe take some pictures from the surface. The final big problem is Titans thick atmosphere but the low gravity might make up for that problem. This is probably a really insane idea so give your thoughts.",1638005987

nasa,r2wr59,awsumguy76801,"Rover on Europa, Enceladus, and Triton?",Everybody talks about Mars rovers but what about rovers on other places specifically icy moons that probably have subsurface oceans that can have life. You see those missions like Triton hopper and Europa lander going to these icy moons and landing on them. But I feel like why a lander how about a rover. How about a 3 target mission with 3 rovers. There would be a main space probe with 3 rovers attached to it as it went to each target it would drop them off there. First at Jupiter the probe detaches its first rover on a flyby trajectory of Jupiter the rover slows down at Europa and lands. The rover has an ice mole and will drive around looking for a place where the ice is weakest to begin drilling. Next Saturn where the probe does the same thing but for Enceladus the Enceladus rover doesn't have a drill instead it lands near the south pole of Enceladus and drives around looking for geysers and collects samples from water vapor that can have bacteria. Final target the probe approaches Neptune and drops off the 3rd and final rover at Triton the Triton rover also lands near the Geysers and will drive to the geysers on Triton to take pictures and study them. The probe will continue on a escape trajectory from the sun and into interstellar space.,1637960612

nasa,r2s3be,OldJuju,I have 0 experience but I want to intern for NASA - any advice?,"For context, I'm a first-year in college studying applied math + economics. (2 majors not a single major with both disciplines.) The issue is that I have no research experience yet/any technical experience at all, but I've recently realized that I am really fascinated with the space industry and would absolutely love to work there. 

Because of classes filling up quickly I can't take my first math course, linear alg, till spring quarter of this year (took up till Calc BC in high school) which is alright, b/c I'm still on a path to graduate in 4 years, but it does put me in a disadvantage with some of my other math peers.

For this reason, I'm hoping to take some math courses during summer '22 (I go to a large public university where this is possible) to catch up and maybe meet some profs and get involved in research. I also possibly? have a finance internship that I can do remotely during this time, but the internship obviously isn't really connected to the space industry. 

In terms of what I'm also doing right now, I'm currently teaching myself python. Still a beginner, but I'm determined to become better. 

Interning at NASA would be a dream come true, but I'm honestly not sure what to do to prepare for an internship in the future.

For problem 1, the cost savings of using less engines probably outweigh man-rating it. Even if they couldn‚Äôt, they could use it on cargo. For problem 2, they are already co-operating with the ESA on the Orion SM. Why not the engines? Plus, international cooperation is good.",1637892330

We know Saturn's rings probably formed when an icy moon was destroyed by some catastrophic event and if this moon was like Enceladus it could have harbored life meaning there could be sterilized alien bacteria inside the ring particles. Sending a mission to Saturn to collect a ring particle and send it back to Earth for study would not only help us understand the rings more but could find alien life. And relatively speaking this would be much easier than sending a lander to Enceladus and drilling through a 100 km thick ice shelf to find alien life in an ocean with crushing pressure when instead we can simply orbit Saturn and sample stuff from a similar environment.,1637815639

The media jokes about billionaires taking joyrides and deride space exploration in general as aloof.  DART is one of those rare missions where everyone already understands what the benefit is.  We all know what happened to the dinosaurs and hollywood has done a good job of hyping up the dangers of sudden rocks from space.  Yes, the possibility is remote but if it were to happen the first thing people (who survive)  will ask is, ""What was nasa doing?"".  Once I've told people about  DART, there is not much further explanation needed.  The reason we should fund this and continue to explore space is immediately obvious. On some level, planetary defense so everyone on earth doesn't die off has a science fiction ring to it that is both  noble and captures the imagination.  

NASA should bring up DART when speaking to Congress  at budget hearings and when speaking to the public.  A planetary defense system to stop killer rocks from space is something we can all get behind.",1637763282

So - Could the Hubble mirror defect be addressed with software if it had occurred today? Algorithms are better than they were in 1990, not to mention AI learning for specific use cases. We've also had  30 years of computing power growth.

I am final year studying renewable energy engineering, and really interested in what my role will be with trying to sort out the mess that is the environment.   

With Cop 26 now ended and in my opinion the climate crisis still not looking like getting solved soon, I‚Äôve been speculating on lots of different options and I‚Äôm fully aware it‚Äôll take a global agreement to try and get counties and companies to agree to become more renewable and carbon-neutral (I believe we have 6 more years until climate change starts becoming permanently irreversible).   

My (ignorant) question is this: Why can‚Äôt we stop funding space exploration for a few years and put that money into trying to fix the climate crisis we are currently facing. I understand space exploration is important and really interesting, but surely at this point it‚Äôs not a priority compared to some other issues (climate, homelessness, hunger, etc.)  

I would still think that funding the bits that can detect meteors and comets incase any were to hit the Earth would make sense as this still would be a priority, but what about the other stuff?

Important to note that he was NASA's Associate Administrator for Human Exploration and Operations between 2005 and July 10, 2019  

They probably didn‚Äôt have him do anything public before because of either it officially still being Hans job even though he was retired to consultant and Gerst has taken over full time so they waited for him to retire fully, or because it would would have award having him represent SpaceX to the NASA admin that fired him.

But dang listening to him during the last few weeks media events with NASA as the NASA rep makes him seem a solid engineer with experience to quickly answer anything technical as well as his view of safety culture. 

Seems a great fit for both, and certainly makes working with nasa teams like it‚Äôs one big team towards a single mission.

If significant, how much better would performance be if the spinner was located at 10,000 feet (Colorado high plains)? 17,000 feet (Atacama)?","I know for traditional rockets that use continuous propulsion, that begins right from the start, at liftoff, aero drag losses are considered fairly minor compared to, say, gravity drag losses by comparison.

But, what about for something like this SpinLaunch method, where the rocket will be thrown, unlit, and not light its engine until it has coasted up through most of the atmosphere?  (And thrown at a fairly sideways angle at that, only around 30 to 40 degrees up from horizontal, I think, which makes it even worse, in regards to aero drag).

It makes me wonder how large of a performance improvement the thing would get if the spinner was located on the high plains of the U.S. (around 10,000 feet up, let's say), or, maybe even higher up at like 17,000 feet on the South American high plains of the Atacama.

I'm picking high plains rather than, say, the tip of Mount Everest because I realize there are logistical challenges if it's steep mountainous territory where nobody can build the thing there or easily ship payloads there.

Thus why I'm picking the elevations of pragmatic flat, high plains of the U.S., and (less pragmatic, but maybe still doable) the Atacama.

Anyway, I'm not very good at physics, and don't know which formulas to use to do estimates based on various size to weight ratios for the rocket vs aero drag of sea level air vs 10k feet air vs 17k feet air.

This thread will serve as an FAQ and megathread - any posts regarding Spring 2022 internships will be removed and directed here. You may post questions in the comments here and the community will do our best to answer them; however your best bet is to email the NASA internships staff for an official answer. 

Internship Website: https://nasacentral.force.com/s/explore-opportunities

When is the application deadline for Spring 2022 internships? November 19th, 2021

When will I be contacted for an interview? Not every position holds interviews. Some mentors have already begun scheduling interviews, while some will wait until applications close. Please be patient. 

When will I know if I got a position? Some mentors have already begun selecting interns, while others have not started. Please be patient. 

Will I get an email if I'm not accepted to a position? It's possible, but not definitive. Hundreds of applicants apply for the same position, so it is not always feasible to email everyone who was not chosen. Some positions may also have become unavailable, and no one selected. 

Do I have to enter my references on each application? Yes. This is a new internship system and certain things are not transferring between applications, including references. Your references will recieve separate emails for each position you apply to. 

When do the internships start? Mid-late January. There may be flexibility depending on the specific position.

Will the internships be virtual or in person? This is a position by position decision - most internships will likely be virtual but some may be in person. 

Feel free to ask any other questions and we will do our best to answer them or refer you to the NASA internships staff for a better answer.",1636513543

**About the Event**

NASA researchers have developed a phase-locked rotor system to reduce noise in multirotor aircraft. Multirotor aircraft typically create a  significant amount of tonal noise from each rotor. Groups of rotors operating at the same rotation rate with an appropriate phase offset can be used to reduce the tonal noise of the aircraft when there are multiple rotors on each side of the aircraft. Reducing tonal noise,  depending on the aircraft design, can effectively reduce the total noise output for a given flight scenario. Aircraft can be designed with this technology to prioritize quieter take-off and landing or can be designed for decreased noise in cruise. Existing designs may benefit from this technology as well, but what type of benefits can be gained depend on the design of the aircraft. Using this method, multiple rotors can be significantly quieter than a single rotor, without sacrificing thrust. This novel technology can be applied to everything from hobby drones to air taxis.

During the webinar, you will learn about this new technology as well as how NASA‚Äôs technologies and capabilities are available to industry and other organizations through NASA‚Äôs Technology Transfer Program.",1636476752

nasa,qmrr76,kittyrocket,Are there any aesthetic considerations in NASA space hardware design?,"Once all technical and scientific requirements for a mission are fulfilled, are any decisions made based on aesthetics? I imagine these opportunities are rare given that form follows function, and function is the unquestionable priority for space hardware. For example, spacecraft color comes from materials (Kapton or aluminum, for example,) thermal management needs (white for radiative or black for reflective,) and visibility (bright orange.) But are there cases where NASA makes decisions outside of  purely functional needs?

There are a few examples I can think of. The first that come to mind are JPL's 'secret' messages in Curiosity's wheel gaps and Perseverance's colored parachute panels. Another is the use of colored panels on the prototype xEMU suits. These even seem to come at a cost. Curiosity's wheels have excessive wear and the xEMU color panels may create marginally more heat load during the lunar day.  

I'm asking about aesthetics in part because I work in the design world and we obsess over things like rounded corners, color choices, typography, white space and so much other stuff. This thought process often isn't obvious to non-designers, and I'm wondering if there's a similar set of unseen aesthetic considerations in NASA's space hardware design.",1636052232

nasa,ql1nnm,stemmisc,"What were the main pros and cons of a triple-hydrolox-first-stage rocket like the Delta IV Heavy? Could they have simply added more, or bigger, solid boosters, or used kerolox engines for the regular Delta IV 1st stage instead? Or, were there some good reasons to make it this way?","From what I understand, hydrolox engines tend to have great Specific Impulse stats compared to kerolox engines, but produce a lot less thrust, and also cost a lot more, and thus tend to be favored as upper-stage engines, rather than as the main 1st stage propulsive method to get a large rocket off the ground.

Or, sometimes as an inbetweener/run-through-and-continue style of additional propulsive source for the first stage, when used in the 1st stage, where the majority of the thrust at liftoff is made by other sources (solid boosters, or kerolox boosters or what have you) and they just sort of run the hydrolox central core along with the rest of the stuff, since it's like, it has a super long burn time and so they might as well get the extra bit of thrust from it running along with all the other stuff (and then continuing to do the majority of its burn long after the rest of the 1st stage propulsion is already done with and dropped away).

But, using just nothing but hydrolox engines, alone, as the lift-off propulsion, as seen in the Delta IV heavy, seems confusing to me.

I'm not being snarky here, btw, I am fairly new to all of this stuff, so, I assume there are some advantages or reasons for doing so, that I might not be aware of, which is why I'm asking about it.

But yea, I don't really understand it.

I mean, I think it is incredibly *cool*, of course, in terms of getting to see three giant hydrolox engines firing at liftoff.  But, in terms of efficiency and practicality, I don't understand why it wouldn't have been better to just use kerolox engines for stage 1, combined with some added extra solid boosters when necessary for heavier payloads, or, at most maybe use just 1-core hydrolox, and use more or bigger solid boosters, or something like that.

That said, I guess its hydrolox engines are of a different style than the super fancy upper stage hydrolox engines or shuttle engines, in that they use a simpler ablative design, if I understand correctly, so, I'm not sure if it's as bad for a cost/pragmatism standpoint, as it seems at first glance, to use an triple, all-hydrolox 1st stage design, in the way that it was done (at that time, anyway).

Yea, so, I guess I am curious to hear people's thoughts on the design of the Delta IV Heavy, and why it was done the way it was done.

**NOTE**:  Let's keep in mind, I think it would be good to keep this discussion in the context of the thought process *at the time it was created*.  Not now, in 2021.  I know times change and so, you can have scenarios where something was a good idea at the time, but isn't as good anymore.  So, let's keep this topic about its design considerations *back when it was created*, if possible.",1635850661

However, it seems just a bit anti-climatic especially for how well he has done to push NASA forward and as a Congressman. It is almost like he has sacrificed all of his ""bargaining chips"" that he amassed during his political career all on NASA to accomplish what he was able to accomplish, and the political world and the public -- while cheering for his success and given him the respect/fame that he deserves -- has not rewarded him for it in any materialistic way. For this, I feel that we are almost under-utilizing his talents here: I feel that his charisma, passion, and ability to unite people of differing opinions under one common goal can be utilized at the National Space Council, back at NASA (perhaps in some other public role), etc.

I am working on a [video game](https://outerspaceshack.com/) on the theme of ""realistic"" space colonization, and I plan to feature in the game existing rockets, starting with Saturn V and Atlas Centaur, and the LEM spacecraft. Of course, this being a personal small project, I cannot pay an expensive license to get any IP rights.

The minimum I need is using the shape of the rockets to make them recognizable, but it would be nice if I could use the name also. Else, of course, I can just change the name like for some cars in some video-games.

I know NASA has a generous policy of all of its IP being public domain, but I am wondering if this includes the rockets and spaceships.

I have a super ethnic asian name, I'm taking 5 years to graduate because I was assaulted during college and my grades slipped, I go to a school that ranks around 100, my GPA is low (3.20), no connections working at NASA, not much relevant experience (I accepted a summer 2022 internship at a company that works with NASA, but that would be after spring), no research (although it doesn't seem as important for the position I want to apply for), etc.

My resume looks good, but it doesn't scream \*great\*. I don't know who the hiring manager is and can't even introduce myself. My dad actually had a NASA offer he turned down 2 decades ago, I wish it was me instead of him ugh

I graduate next fall, so spring is really my only chance. I'm just scared that I'm probably competing against people from MIT and internships at Google, or just a lot of research. If that's the case, how do I even stand out? I was interested in a position at Marshall",1634109225

Instead of allowing you to make one profile to apply for all the internships, you now how to re-type all of your education, employment history, skills, memberships, and experiences for each internship you apply for. 

Also, a letter of recommendation was not required for applying last spring and summer, but now it says it is required for each internship you apply for. Meaning if you‚Äôd like to apply for five projects, your recommender will have to submit it five different times instead of just upload one to your profile.

You also cannot go back to the previous section on the application if you misspelled anything or forgot to add something. It is locked in. There is nothing saying it will be locked in, so good luck if you accidentally do something wrong.

There are other things that are so stupid it seems like a high schooler designed the website. For instance, it asks for your major on one line and your double major or minors on another line. If you input a minor, it will actually list it as a major. So it‚Äôll say you now have 4 majors. You cannot change this because everything is locked in. Why? Who knows. 

I won‚Äôt be applying for internships if they don‚Äôt fix this because I don‚Äôt have time to enter the same information over and over while being a full time student with a job.

nasa,q3ngpm,kittyrocket,"Awkward as heck, but maybe with some benefits?","I came across this 1962 Grumman spacesuit concept sported by the one and only Deke Slayton. Serious question: Are there any more recent explorations of high volume suits like this? I can't think that one would work on the moon or Mars, but I can see some sort of pod-like spacesuit doing well in orbit.

It took a little while to get past the awkward as heck impractical 50's scifi look of this spacesuit, but I did realize there could be benefits. Scott Kelly talked about the physically taxing nature of long spacewalks. One reason is that flexing a joint in a close fitting spacesuit compresses the internal air, adding resistance to any movement. Hardshells and skinsuits seem like the current approach for addressing this inconstant volume problem, but maybe something like this monstrosity could as well? The large interior means that flexing a joint would result in only a very small change in pressure, eliminating that extra effort. Another fatigue related benefit is that an astronaut could pull their arms and legs inside for a more comfortable rest break. (I rest best if I can ball up a bit, so this may be a more individual preference.) The ability to pull in arms and legs would solve for a few other things too. Controls placed on the inside would be easy to use. No bulky gloves necessary. Then what seems like a little thing: the astronaut could itch their nose! I can't imagine the torture of not being able do that. Then finally, the life support system could be housed within the large shell, eliminating the complexity of making the machinery resistant to vacuum and extreme temperatures. 

So while this design looks like the result of some silly hijinks, I can see some benefits. Have there been any relatively recent investigations of design like this crazy one for use in orbit?

My favorite review:

""The incantatory power of chemical names provides the narrative with an epic quality, almost as if the chemicals were characters in a saga and the chemists and engineers minor warring gods or spirits. Workers confront odors next to which the brimstone ones of Hades are as violets, and always looming near are surly phenomena capable of explosive complaints. I enjoyed Clark‚Äôs ever-present sense of humor. Any time the words ‚ÄúI had the bright idea . . . ‚Äù appear, you are about to be told how dangerously un-bright that idea proved. And his clear-eyed assessment of the computers of yore is perfect: ‚ÄúEveryone‚Ä¶has had, from time to time, a mad desire to attack the precocious abacus with an axe.‚Äù Oh, I love that line.""

 NASA's Glenn Research Center has developed non-contact, ultra-bright luminescence-based surface temperature mapping and sensing systems capable of operating in environments with extremely high thermal radiation. This is accomplished through the use of a unique chromium-doped gadolinium aluminate (Cr:GdAlO3) temperature-sensing phosphor. This technology has been proven accurate up to 1300¬∞C - a dramatic increase when compared to current state-of-the-art, which has only been demonstrated up to 600¬∞C. In addition to providing breakthrough temperature measurement capability, this innovation is immune to electromagnetic interference, making it ideal for operation in harsh, high-temperature environments. Furthermore, its unprecedented ultra-bright intensity allows for accurate temperature measurements in the presence of high levels of background radiation.

For more information on the technology, please¬†[click here.](https://technology.nasa.gov/patent/LEW-TOPS-60)

During the webinar, you will learn about this new technology as well as how NASA‚Äôs technologies and capabilities are available to industry and other organizations through NASA‚Äôs Technology Transfer Program.",1632159217

nasa,pob7te,SpaceStockInvestor,NASA Selects Five US Companies to Mature Artemis Lander Concepts,"NASA [has selected](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-five-us-companies-to-mature-artemis-lander-concepts) five U.S. companies to help the agency enable a steady pace of crewed trips to the lunar surface under the agency‚Äôs Artemis program. These companies will make advancements toward sustainable human landing system concepts, conduct risk-reduction activities, and provide feedback on NASA‚Äôs requirements to cultivate industry capabilities for crewed lunar landing missions.

The awards under the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP-2) Appendix N broad agency announcement are firm fixed-price, milestone-based contracts. The total combined value for the awards is $146 million, and the work will be conducted over the next 15 months. The companies that received awards and their award values are:  

* Dynetics $40.8M ($LDOS)
* Lockheed Martin $35.2M ($LMT) 
* Northrop Grumman $34.8M ($NOC)
* Blue Origin $25.6M 
* SpaceX $9.4M 

The selected companies will develop lander design concepts, evaluating their performance, design, construction standards, mission assurance requirements, interfaces, safety, crew health accommodations, and medical capabilities. The companies will also mitigate lunar lander risks by conducting critical component tests and advancing the maturity of key technologies.

The work from these companies will ultimately help shape the strategy and requirements for a future NASA‚Äôs solicitation to provide regular astronaut transportation from lunar orbit to the surface of the Moon.

This opportunity is distinct from the initial crewed lunar landing demonstration mission awarded under the NextSTEP-2 Appendix H procurement, which will serve as the proof of concept for the Artemis architecture.

NASA‚Äôs goals under Artemis include enabling a safe and cost-efficient long-term approach to accessing the lunar surface and becoming one of multiple customers purchasing services in a lunar transportation market. Much of what the agency develops for the Moon will be applied to future exploration at Mars.

NASA‚Äôs Artemis missions include landing the first woman and first person of color on the lunar surface, sending a suite of new science instruments and technology demonstrations to study the Moon, and establishing a long-term presence there.

Can Nasa assure a future for its professional astronauts?,"We regularly see posts on r/Nasa by people whose ambition is to become a Nasa astronaut but, in fact, will being an astronaut remain the best way of going to space from tomorrow onward?

Just looking at the following page may seed some doubts: 

* https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/13/inspiration4-spacex-civlian-space-flight/

Of the crew, two [have](https://inspiration4.com/crew) a pilot's license, one private. The other is a military pilot, but likely pretty rusty in terms of regular flight activity. In an emergency, their somewhat minimal training is said to suffice for flying manually as did the Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley et Bob Behnken flying as [*test pilots*](https://apnews.com/article/us-news-ap-top-news-science-tx-state-wire-virus-outbreak-8918d6d1b5f147d96ac7ab51ed414554).  

We already have a recent case of a Nasa astronaut who retired, never having flown. What next?

Under the same logic, a Dragon or a Boeing Starliner going to the ISS could do so with *only* payload specialists (biologists, chemists etc), just requiring one of them to be maybe a retired USAF reservist plus some leisuretime pilot.  

That's going to put the squeeze on the Nasa astronaut corps among others. 

Later, this could widen to include space EVA activities. An engineer who is also a commercial diver could make a perfect fit for doing outside work on the space station. Taking this further, a mountain guide and/or geologist could be the right candidate for lunar exploration. People building a lunar base could be civil engineers in spacesuits. Will these people consider themselves astronauts and will they *be* astronauts as a primary profession?",1631611191

Instead of space trousers, would something like a baby's sleep sack even rigid leg tube work just as well? I can think of many advantages, including being easier to design &amp; manufacture, lighter, and presumably more reliable due to lower complexity. I've done some searching and haven't seen anything like this. The only thing I can think of is a brief mention of a ""tube suit"" in 7 Eves by Neal Stephenson, which prompted this question.

nasa,pm2wck,DarthTrader357,"We can't mine He3 on the moon, but we can harvest it.","Dear NASA: Artemis needs to determine the ppb off-gassing of weak He3 from Lunar Regolith. This must be the primary objective. The only viable solution to extracting He3 from the Moon depends upon it.

Key takeaways:

* He3 is not an ore body (no economic concentrations), so it can't be mined. Here's how astronomical the problem is.
* You would have to mine and process 60,500,000,000 tons of lunar regolith to harvest 1 ton of He3.
* That is the equivalent of 2,630,000 of the largest gold mine in the world.
* You need 25 tons of He3 to double US power production (or replace current production entirely).
* 1 ton of rock covers 85 square feet. (This comes up later for the weak He3)
* 2,788,000 square feet per mile. (This comes up later for the weak He3)
* 21,670 square miles of surface need to be traversed. (This comes up later for the weak He3)

Sources:

[https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2007/pdf/2175.pdf](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2007/pdf/2175.pdf)

[https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-031306-122626/unrestricted/IQP.pdf](https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-031306-122626/unrestricted/IQP.pdf)

Some math:

* Strong He3 (It will be important later that there's strong versus weak) at most is around 15ppb concentration in lunar regolith.
* It's 7 to 8 ppb most sites tested.
* 1000ppm = 1gram per ton (rough standard).
* 15ppb = roughly 66,600 tons of rock per gram of He3.
* 907,185 grams per ton
* 60,418,521,000 tons of rock per ton of He3.

That's about all the work-shown one should need. I think it's all correct.

Great, now that we got that out of the way. The WPI paper cited above suggests that we can harvest 33kg of He3 per year from a harvester operating continually. But the feasibility prospects are low. Moon rock is:

* 66 times more friction than earth rocks because of lack of water or air.

So unless we have some excellent diamonds, we probably can't use the mining method at all. Let alone mine and process  2 million mines worth of rock.

This is where weak He3 comes in.

Weak He3 is unmeasured, we don't know the exact concentration of it due to how volatile it is and it is released at the barest whiff of disturbance. So no sample could be taken on the Apollo missions. But it is likely to be on the order of 15ppb (which is the rock saturated with strong He3).

If that's true then:

* There are 8,760 hours in a year.
* There's 2.4 miles for every hour in a distance of 21,670 miles.
* Get where I'm going with this?

We let the Regolith act like a sponge for weak He3 and we walk a harvester with a charged plate on the bottom to sniff (collect) the weak He3 as it is released from the regolith by vibration.

The damn thing only has to crawl at 2.4 miles an hour 24/7.

It will harvest 1 ton of He3 per year at that speed.

All we need is for it to be big enough to traverse all the obstacles in its path.

The path should only have to be big enough to traverse a 15 day window (30 miles or so), because at the end of that day it would start to cover its tracks over the Lunar night before retracing its steps in the lunar day.

The way to mine the moon isn't to mine it, it's simply to pass over it.

If the harvester were a mile wide it needs only to walk like an old man across the harvesting field.

We literally already build these kind of mega structures with irrigation crawlers and etc.

It avoids all the problems of mining, no friction, no dust, even.

Lastly, even if the concentrations after a lunar day, of weak He3 were only 1ppb. You simply build 15 harvesters.

15 Harvesters to harvest a ton of He3 per year is far easier than mining 60 BILLION TONS OF ROCK.",1631345160

nasa,pk6cma,SeabassBranch,Why didn't NASA use the Delta 4 Heavy or Atlas V as a replacement to the shuttle?,"Hello! I apologize if I seem ignorant / uninformed (which I am).

In 2014, NASA performed an uncrewed test of the Orion Crew Vehicle on top of a ULA **Delta IV Heavy**, known as **Exploration Flight Test-1.** It took the spacecraft around two orbits of Earth, with one of them having an apogee of 5,800 km. This mission was by no means coming close to being crew ready but did show that **it was possible.**

My question is **why didn't NASA and ULA human rate the Delta IV Heavy/Atlas V rocket and use that as the replacement to the Space Shuttle?** I don't know how expensive this process would've been (something tells me it wouldn't have been cheap), but neither was Constellation's Ares I or SLS.

I'm not saying this would've been the greatest idea, as a DIVH rocket is very expensive (and I don't know if an A5 has the capability), and it would've probably stopped NASA funding Dragon and Starliner. Nonetheless, I feel like it's odd that NASA didn't give more attention to the idea (or maybe they did, and I missed it?)",1631089205

Our goal is to one day send people to live on Mars, to do this, we will need quite bit of funding, and we have a plan to obtain this funding, one that will result in the creation of an interplanetary economy. We will buy payload space on rockets going beyond Low Earth Orbit and sell that payload space to anyone who wants it in an easy to access manner, and with the profits we will buy seats aboard crewed rockets going to Mars.

However to even buy payload space in the first place we will need some initial funding, and we have decided that the best way to get this funding will be via crowdfunding campaigns. Initially we hope to raise around 100K to buy some payload space, likely aboard a rocket going to Mars. If you are interested in supporting this effort, follow our instagram page, (jamestownspaceco). Yes I know how it sounds, but this really isn't about getting likes or getting notoriety on social media, its about giving us a large social media base to get us enough donors to raise the money we need for this to succeed. If you want to join us, comment or dm me asking for the link to our discord server.

**Scott** is a Physician, Passionate Mountaineer (Everest summiter), Trans-Medium Explorer, Author, Speaker, Entrepreneur, and of course, former **NASA Astronaut**.   


He's travelled more than **23 MILLION miles in space**, across 5 missions, conducting 7 space walks in the process. The distance he's covered in space is enough to do 50 return trips to the moon!   


He's an incredibly interesting guy, who has so much to talk about. Amongst other things, we discussed: his childhood and **astronaut** dreams, what it's like to experience a rocket launch, the future of humanity and space travel, how good NASA are at problem solving, if we could live on Mars, and I couldn't let him go without asking for his thoughts on UFOs!   


I hope some of you find the time to watch or listen to the episode, and **I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT!!**   


**LINKS:**

But there are clothes made from antimicrobial fibres that can go months without being washed if necessary. Wouldn't it make more sense to give each astronauts at most a few sets of clothes that were designed to not need frequent washing, rather than to have to ship months worth of clothes into orbit only to burn them up? 

I do realize that the extra cost of shipping clothes to space is negligible in terms of the overall budget, but isn't storage space at a premium on the ISS? Don't months worth of clothes for six astronauts take up valuable space that they could use for something else?",1629832627

I haven't been able to find a lot of information on the topic of my specific heart conditions, but more on heart desise.   


The ones i can remember off the top of my head are:

* **Aortic Stenosis** \- The surgery was open heart when i was about 3 days old, and they cut out my aorta and stitched in a replacement - The first surgery was successfully, but there was inflammation afterword's (I actually don't quite remember what it was) and they had to blow up a balloon in my aorta, attached to a line that went into a vein and through to my heart. This surgery happened when i was about 3 months old - Fixed at present time
* **bicuspid valve** \- not yet corrected, as it is not a danger yet. two cusped valves are more weaker than tricuspid valves, and some people when they are very elderly have to get a valve replaced, even if its tri cusped. mine will happen sooner. someone i know was around late 20's when they had to get the surgery to fix it, and they could barley walk from one side of the house to the other without almost passing out. - Not yet corrected as it is not a current threat (will be in the future)
* **A hole in-between my two ventricles** (i forgot the name of the condition) - this is common, and was corrected in open-heart surgery.
* I believe that's all of them. if I remember one, or have for information ill put it in.

So these are the heart conditions I have. is there any way that I can fly a jet for 1000 hours, or be in zero g for long periods of time to forfill my dreams of becoming an astronaut?  
(optional question to answer): I live in Australia. if I moved to America and got a citizenship and all of the requirements, would I also be able to fly with NASA?",1629686744

nasa,p9klst,robertjan88,Why are developments into space exploration so slow?,"Back in 1969 the world experienced the first moon landing, with the last one being back in 1972. Since then, we have apparently been ""incapable"" of any true developments. Our fastest spacecrafts still hit around 10 km/s, which is 1:30000th the speed of light, and there hasn't been true exploration ever since (not counting Hubble &amp; co).

It seems that currently our biggest achievement is that we are able to launch some billionaires in space...

Why are significant developments into space exploration so slow? Is it just money or are we hitting walls from a knowledge perspective?

Note: I am aware it will take massive amounts of power to even get to a fraction of the speed of light, but we are over 60 years further since we put a ""man"" on the moon, with tremendous technological advancements (e.g. an old pocket calculator is faster than any computer at that time).

I think, even if it's obsolete and we don't use it, *we need to keep it in space for unforseen future purpose.* We may very well *need* a large orbiting structure in space. If we could get it out of our orbit safely, it doesn't really matter what happens to it after that. Deorbiting just destroys it all - but keeping it up there preserves it in all of its glory.


I truly believe that someone like Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk would see the opportunity here. Surely one of them could afford to design an add-on rocket module and enough fuel to move it. Or they could do a few missions now, and add on parts to give it directional thrust. They could attach ion thrust propulsion on each axis, and if they start those bad boys up just a bit farther from Earth (need a boost), we could send the ISS to the moon, to Mars, to IO to Titan, and most importantly, to *Uranus*.


The ISS could serve as all sorts of things - in the future, an asteroid mining operation would save *billions* of dollars by using an existing platform and retrofitting it, versus sending up 100% new equipment. NASA really needs to think this through. I know the ISS flexes, and moving it as a solid body from a single Booster would most likely damage it. If we could disconnect the current modules at their airlocks, and reorient them all in a row, it would allow a single large propulsion system to propel the whole Jim-jam like a big, beautiful arrow of science.


And if we do go with that last idea, and we actually *plan ahead*, we could construct a shielded, long-term living module up front. Something that would sleep a large crew on a long mission, and also protect them from rocks. Since it wouldn't re-enter the atmosphere, using thick steel and lead wouldnt be an issue. Basically a large iron protection dome up front to block rocks.


Alternatively, it could serve as a kind of prison for super-felons.


Alternatively-again, the earth may very well cease to exist at any moment. It would be a good use of innovation to have a comprehensive story of us - more than just a disk - that would in some ways, be enough to almost recreate a new Earth. We could fit a lot on the ISS, even more if we add to it.


The possibilities are really endless. It would require work, of course. But the beauty of it is, *it's already there*. And it's taken how many launches to get here??? I don't think we can just ""build another one"" that easily. What do you think? I'm curious what your thoughts are on the subject. Do you think NASA ought to deorbit the ISS and just forget about it? If they were to reperpose it, what kind of things could they do with it? 


Tl;Dr I think NASA would be setting us all back if they don't reperpose the ISS. Destroying it is a tremendous waste of opportunity.",1628830218
nasa,p3g4wa,Kazeon1,Why is NASA seemingly discussing ways to do away with the international space station all of a sudden?,"No I admit I don‚Äôt follow news probably as much as I should. Mostly because 99% of it is just depressing. But I recently found out that apparently NASA has begun toying with the idea of potentially finding ways to decommission the international space station I believe one thing that I read on Newsweek which admittedly I have taken with a few grains of salt. Says that the station could be decommissioned as soon as 2030.

Why is this? If it‚Äôs because the station is starting to show its age why not replace older sections of it with newer ones. I don‚Äôt exactly like the idea of potentially getting rid of a space station right when the Chinese have started building their own.

Also is it even NASA‚Äòs call if they want to remove the station? I mean it is called the international space station for a reason.

So I would assume that in order to do anything involving the station it would require consensus from the space agencies of all of the various countries that contribute to its maintenance and upkeep.",1628828193

nasa,p3cbng,WellToDoNeerDoWell,Can Cargo Dragon be temporarily undocked to allow room for Starliner?,"We just got [more disappointing news](https://starlinerupdates.com/boeing-works-to-open-starliner-valves-determine-cause-of-valve-issues/) about Boeing's CST-100 Starliner. With persistent issues in the valves, it's unlikely that Starliner will be certified to launch in time for August 20. But after August 20, due to CRS-23 taking up the docking port for the entirety of September, the Lucy mission requiring ULA's resources, and the Crew-2/Crew-3 overlap taking up the docking port again, Starliner may not be able to dock to the ISS until mid-November.

It's quite a shame that even if the problem was fixed such that Starliner would be ready to launch on August 24 or around there, it could be three months before actually being able to launch just due to outside constraints.

So in the instance that Starliner is good to go fairly soon, but misses its launch window and the CRS-23 Cargo Dragon takes its port, I'm wondering if this is a possibility:

1. The CRS-23 Cargo Dragon arrives at the ISS at the end of August
2. The astronauts aboard the ISS take all the cargo out of Dragon
3. Dragon undocks and is held by Canadarm2 for a week
4. Starliner launches and docks to the station
5. Starliner completes its mission objectives
6. Starliner undocks and returns to the Earth
7. Dragon redocks to the station
8. The astronauts load Dragon up with all the things that need to be returned to the Earth
9. Dragon undocks and returns to the Earth at the end of September

In this way, Starliner's OFT-2 mission would be able to coincide with the CRS-23 mission. Is this at all feasible?",1628813634

We've decided to post it to Reddit to share the excitement and perhaps take advantage of anything you guys may be able to contribute to the information we've found so far.

The item is a presentation plaque mounted on a solid piece of wood, produced by Republic Manufacturing (Teledyne) in Cleveland OH in the early 70‚Äôs as an executive gift, to celebrate their role in production of parts for the NASA lunar programme. The valve is mounted to the plinth which is inscribed:‚ÄúTHIS PRECISION VALVE WAS PLACED ON THE MOON BY APOLLO 11, JULY 20 1969‚Äù we bought it from the grandson of a flight engineer who kept it in storage for years. He was given this as a cherished gift by his brother-in-law, Mr Cliff Ostle, who was Vice President of Sales for RM (Republic Manufacturing) in the 1960s. He was presented this plaque by the company in the years following the moon landing. We've found some evidence to support this (see photos), so we're already convinced that the item's origins are genuine, but we're unsure whether the valve was actually part of the Apollo craft or not (and if it was, how did RM get the part back from NASA? Could it have been part of their manufacturing agreement?).

We've found documents from the US Department of Defence which mention RM Co and the valves they produced for NASA (see screenshots), also see documents [here](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=avkRAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA560&amp;lpg=PA560&amp;dq=%22republic+manufacturing%22+%22nasa%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UowQMeJ6Jz&amp;sig=ACfU3U10bGbf1CBxXy7FhV90Vn-nyd6H7g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj936SDm6LyAhVZRUEAHcYmC6sQ6AF6BAgVEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22republic%20manufacturing%22%20%22nasa%22&amp;f=false), [here](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8_URAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA731&amp;lpg=PA731&amp;dq=%22aluminum+alloy+check+valves%22+republic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LjRYK-Nxh3&amp;sig=ACfU3U3ITh9WNOqzE6zUL9kJpdM7F9iZ_w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiIvKvuk6LyAhXRPsAKHYK6CuEQ6AF6BAgFEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22aluminum%20alloy%20check%20valves%22%20republic&amp;f=false), and [here](https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/Invitation-List-1966.pdf).

We're hoping there are people out there with more knowledge of Republic Manufacturing Co, the Apollo space program, the valve itself, or indeed any similar plaques to this one that may have been verified as authentic. We believe the plaque, the part and the backstory are genuine -  I'm sure you'll agree that the wording on the plaque is curious. It seems to directly state that this part has been 'placed' on the moon, but this raises questions. Regardless of whether this part has been to the moon (or even to space at all), I'm sure you'll all agree this is one fascinating item.

nasa,ox8aod,villainelaine,How can I find work at/for NASA in life sciences?,"(TL;DR at bottom)

Hi Everyone! I'm a microbiologist (Ph.D) with experience developing and implementing a flight experiment (my project launched on SpaceX CRS-21!) and I've been looking for a job with/at NASA. I've been searching everywhere I can think of to get in (usajobs.gov, KBR, Jestech, Leidos, plus searching Indeed with a variety of keywords) as well as reaching out to some of my contacts in NASA, but so far nothing has stuck. I also searched at a ton of other companies that have facilities on various NASA bases, but most of them are engineering/software focused.

I've applied to a couple of jobs but never heard back (they are all still posted as well, so I'm not even sure where I stand). I figured I would ask here if there are any companies you all might know of that are involved in life sciences at NASA that I can check for jobs. For context, I have experience designing the experiment, working with and presenting results to non-biology scientists as well as laymen, and in the implementation process for a biology experiment on ISS. My subject expertise is in microorganisms in microgravity, and my flight experiment investigated biofilm arrangement and biofilm-induced corrosion in space flight. I am primarily interested in work either involved directly in research or in supporting and facilitating other's research (for example, I applied to the KBR Life Sciences Integrator-ISS job a month ago, which I am still hoping I get a call for because it sounds perfect for my experience).

Any advice that anyone could give me would be greatly appreciated!

nasa,ouane0,CoopFPV,What would it take to reuse the first stage of SLS?,"The RS25 engines were designed from the start to be reusable for the Shuttle, so that part isn't so crazy. Of course, I believe the engines have been modified for SLS and this may have affected reusability, but the possibility of reusing them is at least not completely ludicrous.

And, most of the SRBs on used by the shuttle-all but four to be exact-were recovered and were used for future flights. I am saying used for future flights and not reused because they were apparently mostly used for parts, rather than truly reusing the same SRBs on another flight. Nonetheless, let's count that as reusable in this case.

One issue is of course that propulsive landings aren't happening with SLS due to the engines not being designed for deep throttling and the fact that there are only four on the first stage. But what if the booster simply took a page from the SRBs book and did a soft ocean landing? This may mean that you can't just recover the stage and refly with some new (or old) SRBs, but again let's count even just significant reuse of parts (especially the $40 million RS25s) as some degree of reusable here.

Of course, reentry control and heating are other concerns, but if you slap on some grid fins and cold/hot gas thrusters and do some test flights to see how the stage fairs through the wall of the atmosphere (and try methods of shielding the booster, like firing an engine/engines for a slowdown/shielding burn as the Falcon 9 does), I don't see that as insurmountable.

A few big unknowns to me, as I am no expert on SLS, are the heat resistance of the material(s) it is made of and the ability of the RS25s to ignite multiple times a flight. A quick search says that the shuttle-era RS25s utilize essentially a big spark plug for ignition, so there isn't any TEA-TEB or other ignition fluid to worry about needing to store.

If engine reignition is absolutely not possible, then just recover the first stage even more like you recover the SRBs, with chutes to bleed off the velocity before a soft ocean landing rather than using the engines. This is also similar to Rocket Lab's method with the Electron, minus the helicopter catch that I imagine is not even close to possible with a super heavy lift launcher.

Of course doing this would limit the payload of the rocket versus flying expendable, but let's ignore that and say most missions are covered by the ability of the rocket in reusable mode.

I know it's crazy, but entertain the fantasy for a moment.",1627607550

I've always wanted to be an astronaut and despite the odds I'm willing to try
So I was wondering
Is there any way I can increase my chances other than specific majors?
For example are there any internships I could apply for
Or space camps
Or experiences
Anything

I have a 3.4 GPA and I'm working to improve
And I'm really into astronomy and astrophysics (not engineering which is why it might be a problem)

So I need to know

So basically I read a book about Mars and how it used to be habitable and how it's old, I've also heard that mars is rusting. So I had a though what if some humans or humans all together were from Mars and that we used to have very advanced technology but we had to leave Mars and head to earth around the time Mars was becoming or became unhabitable. They might have built and arc like those from religions and maybe when the rusting is caused my metals left behind on Mars and we cant find the metals anymore since it's been so long. Also about the space ship, what if its metals are some metals we normally use or it's just naturally become metals we use over time since earth has been here for billions of years.

nasa,os1yes,Wren03,"I'm Worried That at 18, I Have Zero Chance of Ever Seeing Space. Do I Have any Chance of Ever Becoming an Astronaut, or Should I Just Forget About it?","Hi,

My name is Wren, and I'm 18 years old. Ever since I was a kid I just had this obsessive fascination with everything about space and space-travel. For years I wanted to go into Aeronautics and Engineering. I didn't really care how, I just wanted to work for NASA and maybe become an astronaut. But for various reasons, things didn't really pan out during the bulk of my teen years, and that's just not the direction my life seems to be headed. I need help figuring out if this is a dream I need to bury or not.

So, I have this belief that what I do with my life should be dictated by what the world needs of me. I have a lot of things that I'm really really good at, but I've passed up on pursuing a lot because I didn't think it was meaningful enough. Yes, on paper I'm highly to exceptionally gifted, but my intelligence has never really done anything for me, and has just caused a lot of pain. After a really difficult drawn-out battle with mental health issues, I've come to the conclusion that I should do something that makes use of my emotional intelligence.

Yes I could try to do something in business or music or woodworking, but what does that contribute to the world? I know what becoming a therapist would contribute to the world. It would mean preventing some teens and young adults from making a devastating decision, and giving them the tools they need to become successful. Another thing is that thousands of people apply to become an astronaut each year. And out of the close to 20 thousand applicants that may try, only about a dozen actually end up getting accepted. There is a pretty dire need for therapists everywhere, and as soon as I'm certified I would have plenty of job opportunities.

Here's the reason I think this is so stressful to me. I know that even if I put everything into trying to become an astronaut, that it's incredibly unlikely that I would ever be able to see space. And it just fills me with existential dread to know that there's something I will never be able to experience as long as I live. Maybe it highlights my mortality knowing that the window is closing on this and it's not going to open for me again. But at the same time, part of me feels like it would be selfish to even pursue this because there are plenty of other people who would do far better than me.

That's about it. I'm caught between wanting to slot in where I think I'm needed, or pursuing a really individual (and potentially selfish) life's dream. If you've read through all of this, I really appreciate it. I'd also really appreciate hearing your thoughts and feedback on this.

Thank you all for your time,

nasa,opvm8u,Insatiablecannabista,How do two mirrors of the same size see two vastly different sized images of space?,"The old Hubble telescope, and the upcoming Roman telescope will both have the same exact size mirror, being 2.4 meters in diameter.

It is my understanding that the mirror which will be used on the Roman telescope is lighter weight, as well as much more finely ground and polished beyond mission requirements, making any surface defects or bumps less than 1.2 nanometers tall. Where the Hubble telescopes mirror was only ground and polished with surface defects reaching up to 10 nanometers.

As far as I can tell those are the only differences.

So how can the Roman space telescope soo so much more of space than the Hubble telescope can?

And if it's a matter of the camera in operation on Hubble, wouldn't it be more cost effective to just add more fuel and replace the camera on Hubble, rather than building a brand new space telescope that will basically have the exact same job as Hubble?",1627017598

The NASA space agreement with Virgin Galactic was signed last year.  It essentially said NASA will work with Virgin Galactic for training of astronauts to the ISS,  and Virgin Galactic will procure seats to the ISS currently being offered by Space X.

So essentially Virgin Galactic will work with Space X to arrange the training and buy seats on the Crew dragon spacecraft, similar to what Space Adventures does as it would appear.

I have attached links so people can review and come to your own conclusions.  But seems that Virgin Galactic will find the clientele , train them for missions and buy trips to space through Space X crew dragoon seats in bulk and sell them to private astronauts.  Perhaps Virgin Galactic will lease Space X vertical rockets? 

But anyways I wonder if Branson and Musk discussed this further when Elon Musk went to see Branson fly to the edge of space last week at Spaceport America.  Especially now that Virgin Galactic has full FAA approval for space flights .  Would make sense, especially with the NASA agreement signed.

I‚Äôve also been meaning to apply for an internship, but I haven‚Äôt been able to do so since I‚Äôm not a citizen just yet (I will be in about a month). 

Here‚Äôs where I could use some guidance. I am on track to graduate next spring. Would it be worth applying for an internship during this term and delay graduation? Also are there programs available that are related to my field?

If not, are there any pathways I could take that hopefully guide me in the right direction, even if it‚Äôs post graduation?

I was blessed to receive a full-year internship offer from NASA but was told that I could not go abroad and would have to cancel. I *could* try again applying for summer internships, but I have never been more torn on a life decision before.

My career goals lie pretty much in doing software for aerospace/aviation. I am currently interning at Cessna and love the field of work, but I am hoping to move to aerospace. I think NASA would be the perfect internship for me before senior year but I also fear that I'll regret not studying abroad.

Now, the molds is a hard problem to deal with even in space when experiments had shown that they, especially the black moulds can survive an insane amount of space radiation. So killing them outright would be out of the question.

At a lesser degree, if the space station is depressurised to a vacuum level and its temperature reduced to a near-absolute zero level, would it stop the mold's growth, perhaps indefinitely?",1625565966

I'd really love to work for NASA. I interned there as an undergrad and had a grand time, but my academic interests (at the time) diverged a bit.

National labs do super cool work, it's all just starting to seem a bit... directionless.

I know it's hamstringing myself a bit, but LaRC is the most interesting location to me: unfortunately the research they do there is pretty unrelated to my education.

I also have several computer science/STEM extracurriculars, including being the founder of a chapter of a STEM organization, helping to organize a hackathon, tutoring in math, and tutoring in CS. I also have some minor awards in Competitive Programming (USACO Silver, Google CodeJam qualification), and I have won a few hackathons. I also have a lot of personal programming experience and projects, and I'm currently doing a fairly prestigious machine learning internship.

Questions:

1. How difficult is it to land computer science/programming positions as an intern? I know the main focus is on engineering and robotics, so I would like to see where I stand, and how available such positions are.
2. How should I present myself on my resume to maximize my chances of getting in? Should I focus more on my programming experience and internships to show I'm competitive with college students?
3. If I want to present my projects, is it viable to create a portfolio with Github links to my projects along with short descriptions?
4. Is it usually harder to get in through the regular gate ([intern.nasa.gov](https://intern.nasa.gov/)), or Pathways?
5. If I don't have luck with either of the aforementioned routes, is there any way for me to do a fall/year-round session at JPL? I currently only see that the internships are open for undergraduate/graduate students, so I'm not sure if there's any way high school students can get in.

I know it's incredibly difficult to get an internship at NASA, but it's been a dream of mine to intern at NASA for years, and I'm determined to do whatever it takes to get in.

nasa,o8rzxr,sagarthedark,How do I get into NASA in the future?,"Hey everyone! I'm an 18 y/o currently enrolled in my first year of Bachelors in Electronics and Communications engineering from a good university in India. Space has always been my passion and it was what has fuelled me to select this engineering course since my uni didn't have an aerospace program (also since I read many, many posts that a core mechanical/electronics degree is better overall for pursuing an aerospace job). NASA obviously played a huge role in getting me inspired for space, everything they do just seems really cool and it's something that I want to be a part of.

My university is accredited through the Washington Accord MRA, so that's not a problem.

On to the question;

The aerospace sector in India is quite terrible. I've seen far too many people talk about it and I don't want to end up doing some technical maintenance jobs or such.

1. I like electronics and even though I haven't really explored them too much, what kind of courses or programming languages should I learn that would enable me to do projects related to aerospace? 
2. Money is an obstacle. I will need a good scholarship to be able to attend a university in the USA for my Master's. I've seen a student from another uni that I got accepted into, pursue the same course as me, go to Carnegie Mellon, and rn he's working for NASA. Are there any universities I should specifically consider for my Master's, that would increase my chances?
3. I would like to pursue either robotics/avionics/systems engineering. If there are any other viable options for me to pursue a Master's in, that would land me closer to NASA/other aero organizations, then please do suggest.
4. There is an aeronautics club in my college. They only design airplanes for competitions, but I've joined it and I'm going to actively take part in it. Is there anything else I can do in college to get me closer to my dream?",1624777377

nasa,o2x2br,stemmisc,"Why has there not been much done in direct-impulse beamed propulsion, so far? Seems like it would allow for DRASTICALLY increased delta-V. Is it something to do with needing to be built or placed on the moon (or similar), or some other issue?","I was reading a lot, these past few days, about various propulsion methods that have been used so far, for various space missions, from the ordinary chemical rockets of different sorts, to the more advanced ion thruster designs that have much higher ISPs, to solar sails, and also some methods that have been theorized and proposed for the future, like various nuclear designs, and so on.

But, by far and away the thing that caught my eye the most, was beamed propulsion, specifically the direct-impulse version, where the thing emitting the beam is not on the spacecraft itself, but rather, is sitting (like a building) on some planetary body (like the Moon, or Earth, or maybe on a large craft in LEO) with as much fuel/power source as it wants (relatively speaking, compared to the spacecraft), since it's not going anywhere, itself, which just shoots a beam of light at the lightsails of a spacecraft that is floating in space, which accelerates the craft to higher and higher velocities (potentially EXTREMELY high velocities, like millions or tens of millions of mph (so, several percent of the speed of light, potentially).

This seems like a really good idea, and (at least at first glance, anyway) doesn't even seem all that complicated.  Like, just shoot a beam at the back of a spacecraft, and away it goes, faster and faster, not having to carry its own fuel source, thus, able to get to unprecedented speeds compared to spacecraft that have to carry their own fuel).

Now, this would be a one-way-ticket, flyby / fly-into-deep-space kind of propulsion method, because, well, good luck trying to slow the craft back down once you've accelerated it to gazillions of mph with that beam (unless there was another beam-shooting device located on the destination body, pointed in the opposite direction, to slow it back down.  (well, technically I guess you could just use the method to a much milder degree, for intra-solar system missions, like only accelerate it to more moderately high speeds via the beam, and have a bunch of fuel on board the craft to be used for deceleration, that way you could have it go twice as fast as if it didn't use beamed propulsion for its acceleration method, since you can use all your fuel for deceleration instead of having to split it in half with 1/2 being for accel and the other 1/2 being used for decel or whatever.  So, even there, it would be a nice, useful thing that could maybe cut travel times of probes to bodies within our solar system in half, which, even that is not nothing, and would be pretty cool, and useful).

But.... *still*... as far as flyby/fly-away missions, even just having a way to send spacecraft off into deep space at ultra high speeds that were several orders of magnitude higher than any self-contained-propulsion methods we've had so far, even if you had no way to slow it back down, would be a really big deal, and an utterly gigantic leap compared to the best delta-V generating propulsion methods we've been using so far.

And it seems that they came up with this method over 30 years ago, and there hasn't been much in the way of actual missions using this method so far.

So, what gives?

Is it just strictly an issue of needing to put the beam-cannon outside of Earth's atmosphere (i.e. on the surface of the moon), or something like that?  And thus, they've just had to keep waiting for us to return to the moon, so that we'll have astronauts who can set the beam-cannon up on the moon's surface to be able to use it?

(Although, I guess in theory maybe you could even have the beam-cannon just be in LEO or something like that, if its mass was a lot heavier than the mass of the spacecraft it was shooting its beam at, (sort of like when you shoot a rifle, the rifle doesn't move back very fast when the gun fires a round, but the bullet goes extremely fast, since its mass is tiny compared to the rifle's mass, so, even though they are both experiencing the same amount of force (in opposite directions), that amount of force applied to the much lighterweight object will propel it by a drastically higher amount, in comparison to the heavier object.  But I digress).

Or, are there some other serious issues with the direct impulse beam propulsion method that I'm not aware of (like, I dunno, maybe it overheats the spacecraft or melts its sails or, they can't figure out how to design a beam-cannon that would produce the kind of beam necessary to use for shooting at the back of the spacecraft or something, or, I dunno what other sort of possible issue, that is hampering this whole propulsion method)?

Anyway, yea, I am very curious about this propulsion method, and what the main thing (or things) is/are that are causing it to not already have been used on a bunch of velocity-focused deep space missions (of the Voyager/New Horizons type) (or, even some of the intra-solar system missions too maybe, to cut down the times to those planets also would've been nice.  Although by far its biggest proportional gains would've been for those off-and-away into deep space types of missions, where these deep space probes could've been, I dunno, maybe halfway to Alpha Centauri by now, with this type of propulsion method, rather than only less than 0.1% of that distance.

Yea, so, I am curious to know what the deal is with this and why they haven't really been using this propulsion method as of so far.  It sounds fantastic.  But, I assume there must be some catch, or else they would've already used it a ton, during these past few decades.",1624041634

nasa,nx4hh4,TMWNN,Who would have piloted early shuttle flights if NASA didn't have the MOL transfers?,"When the Defense Department canceled [MOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_Orbiting_Laboratory) in 1969, 13 of its 14 astronauts wanted to transfer to NASA. Deke Slayton didn't think he needed even more astronauts given that he already had a surplus from [NASA Astronaut Groups 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Astronaut_Group_5) (pilots) and 4 and 6 (scientists) competing for the few remaining flights until the space shuttle, but took the seven youngest MOL astronauts as [Group 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Astronaut_Group_7) to keep the military happy. He warned them that none would fly until the shuttle became available around 1980.

While Slayton was right in that none in Group 7 would fly until the shuttle, he was wrong in that the agency did need them. Two of the four astronauts who flew the shuttle ALT tests were ex-MOL. STS-1 through STS-6 each had a ex-MOL astronaut as pilot with a veteran astronaut as commander, and the seventh ex-MOL astronaut also flew on STS-6 as mission specialist.

If NASA had not received the MOL transfers, who would have piloted the early shuttle missions? Some possibilities:

* Some Group 5 astronauts who commanded early shuttle missions instead serve as pilots. Joe Engle (who had flown to space on the X-15 but not as a NASA astronaut) might have piloted STS-1 with John Young (I think the only Group 3 or earlier still serving as astronaut in 1981) for example, instead of commanding STS-2. NASA clearly wanted to simultaneously a) have a space veteran as commander, b) spread out veterans' flights to give each a chance to command, and b) quickly turn rookies into veterans so they could command their own missions.

* The 15 pilots in [NASA Astronaut Group 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Astronaut_Group_8) (""TFNG""), chosen in 1978, get to fly earlier. Fred Hauck, Dan Bradenstein, and Brewster Shaw piloted STS-7 through STS-9 in 1983, and Hoot Gibson, Dick Scobee, and Michael Coats first flew in 1984, so they would be the logical choices. But would NASA feel comfortable with rookie pilots flying in 1982 or even 1981? I don't know offhand who flew as pilot the soonest after NASA astronaut selection during the shuttle program.

* Some of those who retired from the astronaut corps in the 1970s decide to stay. This is the least likely outcome. Of the 17 Group 5 astronauts who flew in space, all but Don Lind and Bruce McCandless first did so on Apollo or Skylab (or X-15 for Engle). In other words, they were already veterans and would surely have been early shuttle commanders had they chosen to stay; Fred Haise is an obvious example.

* Lind and McCandless, the two Group 5 astronauts who didn't fly until the shuttle‚Äîand did so as mission specialists, not as pilots‚Äîpilot early shuttle missions. During the 1970s Lind (physics PhD) was informally reclassified as ""scientist"" and not ""pilot"". McCandless, as I understand it, continued training as shuttle pilot into the 1980s, but was also informally reclassified as ""scientist"" at some point.^1 Neither had test pilot experience. So even without Group 7, Lind flies as a mission specialist.^2 Even if McCandless flies as pilot, that covers only one of the six early shuttle pilot slots that ex-MOL filled.

Perhaps the most likely scenario without the ex-MOL astronauts combines the above:

* Engle flies as pilot with Young as commander on STS-1.

* McCandless flies as pilot with Lousma as commander on STS-2. Or, two Group 5 veterans fly together on STS-2.

* Hauck/Bradenstein/Shaw fly in 1982, not 1983.

^1 Also, I think McCandless says in his NASA oral history interview that he chose to fly as mission specialist because a) he thought he would fly earlier and b) he would use the MMU. He was probably wrong about a); had he stayed as pilot he would surely have flown before Group 8.

^2 That said, there were other Group 5 members who weren't test pilots, so Lind not being one in and of itself didn't disqualify him as a pilot astronaut. So it's not impossible that Lind gets re-reassigned as such once the late 1970s pilot shortage becomes obvious. I don't know if Lind kept up his flight hours, thought.",1623376398

nasa,nu127q,Gordopolis,Astronaut Shannon Lucids M&amp;M Breakdown on Mir,"Back in the 90s as a space obsessed kid, I remember reading an article about astronaut Shannon Lucids stay on Mir.  It made particular note of a request she made for M&amp;M candies and framed her request as occurring due to extreme mental stress, inferring she experienced some kind of mental breakdown in orbit.  

As a kid this really made an impression on me as I had never really considered the psychological impact of isolation in space.

Recently, I went back looking to find the article or mention of her breakdown and I can't seem to find anything but the most casual benign mention of it:

------

&gt;[""Lucid also said that Russian space food was ""pretty good""‚Äîwith beef stew being her favorite‚Äîbut she really missed M&amp;M¬Æ candies.""](https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/nasa2/nasa2.htm)

------
&gt;[""Clinton had sent a letter of commendation and a large box of M&amp;Ms; embossed with the presidential seal. During her stay on Mir, Lucid confessed to having a sweet tooth and said she especially craved M&amp;Ms""](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-09-27-mn-48138-story.html)

-----

&gt;[""While there, she studied the effects of space on living tissue, the growth of protein crystals and the development of quail embryos - and requested new shipments of novels and M&amp;Ms candy.""](https://www.oklahoman.com/article/2649849/shannon-w-lucid)

------

It definitely seems like her request was national news at the time but I can't seem to find any articles that frame it the way I read about it - as an response to extreme stress, inappropriate and a sign of a possible mental breakdown.

nasa,nrk7f8,stevecrox0914,State of System Engineering?,"To my knowledge Nasa invented System Engineering and I am wondering how people in Nasa feel the discipline will progress?

When I started in software engineering, the company I joined did a lot of work in defence/aerospace. System engineers ruled, we drew up software design documents with hundreds of requirements captured in Doors, you were expected to draw sequence, use case, etc.. diagrams in Artisan/Enterprise Architect. All unit/integration test steps were written first in Doors and traced to use cases which traced to Doors. We would have to plan every class, every function and complete software validation and software verification documents. The documentation could be larger than the thing it documented.

But you could never completely think out the scope of a project, sometimes practically implementing something would change how you approach it. So periodically you would dig out the documentation and update. But since things like Word don't integrate with an IDE, you get drift from the plan and no one would catch it, because everyone's focus wanders after 100 pages of function descriptions.

The sheer complexity of software interactions drove a change in software. The discipline looked to shrink the problem space down we developed software oriented architecture, then micro-services, the placed those in containers to ensure reproducibility. 

The complexity meant they wanted to reduce the time to discover something was broken. Which gave us Agile where there needs to be review and something delivered in fixed intervals encouraging a minimum viable product approach. This encouraged more automation through continuous integration and continuous deployment to enable releasing and testing inside of the development cycle. 

It hasn't been a perfect evolution, operations staff have often fought the concept of DevOps (check out r/sysadmins pre-covid posts). Viewing automation as an enemy, developers as cowboys, etc.. Which has forced developers to learn (and relearn so many lessons).

For the last 5 years I worked for a company that was heavily ""Agile DevOps"" based and looking at those projects compared to the CMMI level 5 company I started with, what they produced is better. The documentation was more useful and accurate, we could ensure full test traceability, team productivity could be tracked catching in trouble projects early and the amount of metrics we could get out of a build meant there were more test scenarios, better focussed tests, be code commenting, less technical debt, etc.. 

Yet in that 5 years except for one individual every system engineer I have introduced to a project gets very angry about how much of a cowboy operation it is. Which is frustrating because over the years digging out an ancient INCOSE book and thinking about its perspective and trying to adapt it to fit Agile has been really useful (similar to discovering how ITIL explains why IT departments work like they do).

Which got me thinking..

Projects like Orion, SLS, Percy are atleast as physically complex as the software projects I worked one when I joined the industry and they were stretching the traditional approach.

nasa,notved,redditigon,I asked a question on repeating manned mission to moon and..,"I gather the following from the comments (thanks to everyone):

- It is a VERY expensive affair and we could do it in 1969 mainly due to political (read USSR) reasons (though why did we go more than once back then if going once was enough to prove that point?)

- It is so expensive that YouTube streaming of it really won't cover the cost. And also there is no Earthrise (which was actually shot from space) on moon..only Earth and sun in the same frame! (With streaming on YouTube, its not just revenue but also the sensitization of people that hopefully would translate into public will for tax dollars).

- It seems we have lost the tech or that the tech used in '69 is outdated and has not been built upon since then. Besides, public won't accept any failed missions in the present day. Nevertheless, there is a moon mission..for lack of a better phrase..on the horizon. And there are private players trying to do what they can.

- There was mention of a recent Chinese unmanned mission to moon but I could not find any original high res images or videos from it (any links will be appreciated).

I therefore have a second question. Can we not send an unmanned, one-way Perseverance like mission to the moon for the purpose of images of/inside the craters, recorded footage and sound and similar data. Being unmanned, it may take longer than 3 days to reach to cut cost. Just curious why it has not been done so far, and why don't we have those high res images and data with us already given thst moon is so much closer than Mars. TIA

Do you guys think that there is any truth to this story?

For some context, the first time humans landed on the moon was in 1969. The last time humans landed on the moon was in 1972. Humans haven't returned to the moon in nearly 50 years despite our way advanced knowledge and technologies. The reasons I've researched online are rather simplistic, essentially saying ""the US is no longer competing with Russia"" or ""it's too expensive"", yet they went numerous times between 1969-1972 and than just abruptly stopped.

nasa,nmnvj5,7r3m0r45,Amateur Post: Can a black hole singularity actually be the death of the black hole due to the extreme relativity?,"I have something that I've been thinking about with the ""singularity"" of a black hole. Due to the insane amounts of time relativity going on in and around a blackhole, can the singularity of a black hole stretch all the way to the point of the black holes death? As you fall into the black hold you quickly see all the universe spin around the outside viewable area of the blackhole. As it collects matter and energy the distance the singularity pulls down spacetime increases. I know the age of black holes seem infinite but maybe the actual singularity is the point at which the hawking radiation kills the actual black hole itself. Seems like it makes sense that your short time inside has plenty of time to collect everything necessary as you fall into it. Could it reach an equilibrium where all matter arrives at the near the same time for the ""death"" event.

The collapse of a star into a black hole is the tough part to explain in this idea. Can the collapse create frontal shockwave enough to make the material not completely hit the singularity to allow everything else falling into it ""catch up"". 

It just seems like a pretty cool brainstorming idea that I'd like people to tear apart for me.",1622169471

I am a 21 year old community college student who will be transferring in the fall to a state university for BS cpt engineering and MS data sci. I am apart of L'SPACE and plan to work as hard as I can to have a rich, long relationship with NASA. 

I have been buried in technical studies for years, basic calculus curriculum/programming/engineering physics. As I am transferring soon I have found more time to learn about astrology, planets, galaxies and moons just out of pure curiosity. 

In learning (as best I can) about our galaxy, the local group, Laniakea, and finally the idea of dark energy and a constantly accelerating universe... I am left genuinely anxious, scared, and empty feeling. To the point that at my day job I just look at people puzzled, with a strange feeling that they are so ignorant worrying about stupid little problems meanwhile our reach is decreasing with every second. 

I am just sad. I thought humans getting onto Mars would be an extremely large step in expanding our reach, but it isn't when considering the scale of things. I am saddened and overwhelmed. I have been here before, though. I've been diagnosed with a terminal disease and had these exact feelings- I am no stranger to this. I know what's to come, I know what needs to be done, and I will do my best until the day I die to help.

I don't know whether I'm going to join the military after I graduate or go for my masters immediately I'm trying to determine exactly what would be the best course of action I'm considering going to graduate school at Stanford or MIT I'm kind of favoring Stanford simply because of its proximity to the jet propulsion lab and are their internship opportunities.

I Have interned for NASA when I was in high school and I interned for Boston dynamics when I was a sophomore in college so I'm just trying to decide what to do next what would be the best course of action should I join the military to increase my chances of being admitted to the astronaut program or would going the direct academic route and getting my masters immediately be my best course of action?

I'm just trying to decide what my next move should be if my ultimate goal is to be an astronaut I know this is a little silly to ask and I know the odds of actually achieving this goal are slim because of just the amount of people that apply and the qualifications needed but it what I wanna do so any advice would be greatly appreciated thank you in advance.",1621677441

 so in that case we can make  air suction tubes around airplanes with small holes where air will come out of with such invention we will have a layer of  air around the plane which would give it less resistance.
 p.s  im stil waiting for you to make a catapult type space port which would save a lot of  energy from the take off
 because lets face it the hardest part of a rocket takeing off is from 0 to 100
  which if we had a catapult launch on it it would make it go faster at 0-100  with less fuel consumption
p.s kam the genius. 
 i have more ideas but  those once im scared to give out due to bad people useing it to their advantage.",1621355978

nasa,nb48g4,NanoSpace1540,US Senate bill providing an additional $10Billion to HLS passes committee," 

Hey all, quick political warning before I continue, usually I don't think most people want this type of thing to pop up, but I believe it's important enough to put together, especially since it seems to have gone a little under the radar.

So to recap, NASA last month selected SpaceX to build a lunar lander under the HLS program. Both Blue Origin's National team and Dynetics both lost out on the Option A contract and both filed claims against NASA to the GAO.

Going through the motions of congress at the moment is a bill, S. 1260, otherwise known as the [Endless Frontier Act of 2021](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1260), that provides funding to a variety of technology and innovation projects to rival funding that China is doing. Currently the bill is very much bipartisan and supported quite heavily on both sides of the aisle, so there's a good chance that it will pass the Senate, which is usually the big hurdle to legislation the past several years.

This morning during the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee markup meeting, senators Cantwell D-Washington and Wicker R-Mississippi offered an amendment to the bill that will provide NASA's HLS program with an additional $10 Billion in funds through 2026. By the end of the markup meeting the amendment was added to the bill and the committee voted on a bipartisan 24-4 to send to the full chamber.

If approved by congress and signed by the President the money is expected to be used to offer Blue Origin's National Team a contract. If you want to read up on the approved document I'll link it below. Subtitle B, which is the general section of NASA starts at page 11, but the portion about HLS is from pages 14 through 17.

What is everyone's thoughts on this? I'm just happy in general when congress decides to give NASA more money.

[Approved bill as amended by Senate Committee](https://spacepolicyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Senate-NASA-auth-amendment-May-12-2021.pdf)

I've been hawk-eyed to the USAJobs listing for NASA for almost half a year. NASA puts out a lot of jobs! However, only a fraction get to work at the incredible Kennedy Space Center.

I'm about to receive my M.Sc. in Computer Science and have the experience required to work some positions. I've been forwarded/accepted to \~7 different positions that are still reviewing the applications.

The first application I sent dates back to February. I was told within a week I would be referred to a hiring manager and that I was eligible for six jobs I applied for. However, that makes it almost four months ago from the first time I was told that.

I would love to work at NASA because I love space and science, but my small town Danish sweetheart wants to experience Florida. Working at the Kennedy Space Center is a prideful, perfect dream. For us both... She still thinks I'll get contacted back one day. She always has hope.

These are kind of a technical programming questions, so it would be really cool if anyone here works for NASA can answer them:

\- Does NASA use the Rust language or plan on using it in the future? How can I find more info on this?

\- Would it be a safe bet to assume that Rust could be a strong choice in the future for certain NASA projects? And would it be a good choice to learn for future opportunity?

I'm not asking if learning Rust will get me a job at NASA, but it would be really cool to see them use the language (and the benefits that come with it) and maybe contribute to an Open-source project from them someday when I get more experience with the language (assuming they will ever use Rust).

Anyone have any info on this?

So first we thought 2 bodies attract each other, and the attraction depends on their mass. 

Then Sir Einstein showed thay due to heavy mass, space time is bent, and smaller mass objects just rotates in that bent space time around the heavy object (kinda). 

Now wouldn't that mean Earth üåç should eventually  get closer and closer to Sun üåû and fall onto it? I'm really curious ever since I've read about the new Unicorn black hole discovery news.

nasa,n6ddse,FlyingSaucer23,Taking a permanent position at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in June 2021 after completing my Pathways Internship Employment Program (EIP) and a Bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering. How soon could a request a transfer to NASA Johnson Space Center if I wanted to live/ be closer to family in Texas?," Just to clarify, I have received the permanent employment offer letter, and the date I would start is June 20th 2021. I love that I will be working at NASA, and GSFC is great, but there are several factors for which I want to live in Texas, one of them being that I am from there. After being away for 10 years from Texas, due to serving in the NAVY, university, internship, I have now developed an immense appreciation for everything about Texas.

In short, I want to know how soon after taking my permanent position at GSFC I can go to my branch head and ask if it is possible to transfer to JSC when an equal/tradable position comes up from JSC (i.e. someone with similar skills and GS level to me, wants to transfer from JSC to GSFC).

I have heard it is very difficult for that to happen, and the other option is to apply to a position directly at JSC, but since I will be starting as a GS-7 Step 10, I have never seen engineering positions of that GS level show up at JSC. I often see GS-13 through GS-15 positions all the time, but it will take me at least 5-7 years to reach GS-13

I just want to live in Texas to be near family, and ideally want to continue to work for NASA. Have any of you ever had, or know of anyone who has, transferred between centers at such an early stage of their career at NASA? If so, how difficult is it? And, what is the best way to proceed about requesting/making this goal of mine happen?

Finally, should I ask this question to my HR once I call him back to accept the GSFC permanent position offer, or is this a bad idea?",1620324066

We chatted about the three current mars missions, why we're calling the drone a helicopter and whether the first settlers of Mars will eventually rebel and act a fool. 

Most interestingly, she said 'the primary function of a universe is to turn gas into stars'...Which is something I'd never heard phrased that way and was fascinated but its reductive simplicity.

However, in the time before I submitted my admission I got offered a paid internship for a firm where I live but the situation surrounding that is a bit feeble and I'm not 100% sure I'll be able to get that internship. If I accept my admission to the L'Space program am I able to step back BEFORE the program actually begins? Or is it that once I accept it, I'm locked in for the summer? I don't want to give up my spot in the program but if I can make that internship work I don't think I'll be able to juggle both workloads at once. But, if I turn down the L'Space offer and don't get the internship then I'll have lost out on two great opportunities. 

Also, how much time do I have to accept the offer? Will it expire tonight, tomorrow, in a week? It doesn't specify in the email.

I feel a bit guilty being stuck between these two things but it's important to me I make the right choice.

The Millennials of which I am one seemed to have been more interested in fame and fortune. Gen Z are rightly concerned with social issues but are dismissive of space exploration.

There was a Stephen Baxter novel written in the 90s that had frightening parallels to the times we are living in now. An America engulfed in anti intellectualism and a youth culture in a downward spiral with social media. ""Titan"" it was called.

Why has space and space exploration become ""lame"" to people who grew up in the 90s, 2000s, and 2010s?

It is bad enough many young people think the Moon landings were faked but it is another thing to have young people saying absurd things like ""space is fake"".

There is hope though. There seems to be interest in getting the next generation interested in space. There is an astronaut show on Nickelodeon.
